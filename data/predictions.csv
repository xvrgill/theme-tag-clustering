Key takeaways
Republicans on the defensive
Biden’s lead and cash support for Democratic candidates have Republicans on the back foot in red states.
Good and bad news for Democrats
There are more Republican seats in play, but many of them are in usually reliable red states.
Several Senate scenarios to consider
Regardless of who wins the presidency, the fortunes of the next administration rest solely in the hands of the Senate.

A year ago, anyone who looked at the map of Senate seats up in 2020 would have concluded that Democrats had a difficult path back to the majority. Fast forward a year and the persistent lead of former Vice President Joe Biden over President Donald Trump, along with a gusher of campaign cash for Democratic candidates, suddenly has Republicans playing defense in usually reliable red states. The good news for Democrats is that there are more Republican seats in play than Democratic seats. The bad news for Democrats is that many of those seats are in red states.
With a nation just days away from the election, we consider the factors that give Democratic challengers hope and Republican incumbents cause for concern, including:
1)      Money
It’s long been said that money is the mother’s milk of politics, and that could not be more accurate than this year. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has raised more than $244 million in this cycle compared to $148 million in 2018. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has raised a similar amount this year, bringing in nearly $220 million – about $70 million more than they raised in 2018. Individual candidates are raising eye-popping sums as well, changing the shape of races once thought safe. This pattern of Democrats significantly outraising Republicans is playing out in battlegrounds across the country.
2)      Potential Senate scenarios
The dream scenario for Democrats is a blue wave that washes over the nation, carries Biden to the White House, and gives him a majority in both the Senate and House of Representatives. The key questions in this scenario are how large a Senate majority may be and whether it will be enough to allow Biden to enact some of his more ambitious agenda items.
A second scenario is a Biden victory and Republicans retaining the Senate. In this case, the Senate will continue to be the place where Democratic agenda items go to die.
A third scenario is an evenly split Senate, 50-50. With a Trump victory, Vice President Pence would be the tie-breaking vote, leaving Republicans in control and two more years of status quo inside the Beltway. A Biden victory with Vice President Kamala Harris playing the role of tiebreaker may give Democrats control but no clear path to implementing a Biden agenda in the Senate.

Senior Portfolio Manager, Head of Global Tactical Asset Allocation Solutions


The return of the coronavirus across Europe and the Americas represents an important risk factor for the global economic recovery. We contemplated this risk back in the spring and outlined a baseline scenario of a meaningful second wave of COVID-19 infections across the northern hemisphere upon the return of colder temperatures. The probability of a double-dip recession in Q4 2020 is certainly increasing across multiple regions, but it does not need to translate into the same economic and financial shock experienced with the first wave. A combination of ample monetary and fiscal policy support, together with economic adjustments and measures implemented over the past seven months, is likely to reduce the uncertainty associated with this second wave compared to the first.
In this month’s tactical asset allocation outlook, we discuss:

Why our forward-looking measures of economic activity and market sentiment continue to suggest the global economy should remain in a recovery regime in the near term
How the relative growth momentum between the United States and other developed markets has tilted in favor of the former
Why emerging markets, particularly Asia, appear to have entered an expansion regime
The implementation of one change to our investment positioning

Why we maintain a higher risk posture than our benchmark1 in our Global Tactical Asset Allocation model

Our base, upside, and downside scenarios for 2021 call for a policy-fueled recovery, led by China.
Base case

Our base case has China outperforming. The US and eurozone pause their re-opening with partial lockdowns, while fiscal and monetary policy continue to support activity. Meanwhile, manufacturing continues to lead, while a recovery in service sectors transpires, assuming a vaccine is rolled out broadly in H2 2021.

“V” for accelerated vaccine

In our assessment of upside risks, we assume a vaccine is approved early and broadly in use in H1 2021, driving a faster recovery. We also incorporate further expansionary fiscal policy actions.

Double-dip

Downside risks include severe secondary waves, requiring renewed national lockdowns in many countries. Concurrently, the benefits of fiscal and monetary support are delayed as in during the first wave. Political will and fiscal space for these policy actions prove to be less than in 2020.

The upside and downside risks for major economies
We anticipate that the US and Europe will recover in fits and starts, while China begins the year on strong footing.

The retirement savings gap between men and women is significant. When it comes to their financial security, women are considerably more stressed than men because they face a gap in salary equity, career continuity, and access to employer-sponsored plans. 1
However, there are ways that plan sponsors can narrow the gap, including:
Leveraging the power of higher deferral rates
Women would benefit from being more aggressive when it comes to the amount that they put away for retirement. While 73% of full-time female employees are saving for retirement at work, they are only contributing about 7% of pay, far below the recommended level to reach a healthy retirement savings amount.2 The Defined Contribution Institutional Investment Association recommends automatic enrollment of at least 6% to start for all workers, with escalation features rising 1% to 2% annually up to a 10% contribution rate cap.
Starting a conversation about the need to invest for the long term 
Just 31% of women feel financially secure overall.1 And when it comes to investing, women tend to invest more conservatively than men. While being overly aggressive is certainly problematic, being too conservative carries dangers of its own — especially considering that women should be investing for a longer time horizon than men.3 Employer encouragement can help women improve their financial confidence and better understand how changes to their spending, savings, and investing behavior would impact their financial future.
Tailoring their message to a woman’s point of view
Based on more than 10 years of in-depth research into the language used when communicating with investors, Invesco has found that women and men have different learning styles and communication preferences.4 Overall, we found key principles that resonate with many women investors, including providing an experience before explanation, aligning life goals with financial goals, and maintaining a positive message.

Every company that sponsors a 401(k) plan has several people with responsibility for its operation. Most are fiduciaries whether they know it or not. A fiduciary includes anyone who can make decisions about the plan’s investments, expenses, and providers, including plan committee members, the officers and managers of the employer who make plan decisions, and the president or board of directors that appoints the committee members. Each fiduciary has a duty to act prudently and in the best interest of the plan participants, so it is critical that they fully understand their responsibilities.
In this article, we review five common fiduciary mistakes made by plan committees, along with potential solutions to help them understand and satisfy their fiduciary responsibilities:
Not having an investment policy statement (IPS)
An IPS is a roadmap to compliance. It covers the types of investments to be offered by the plan and the criteria for selecting those investments, including expense ratios, share classes, and qualitative measures. While 91% of large plan sponsors have an IPS in place, best practices dictate that not only should the IPS exist, but it should be appropriate for the plan.1
Failing to regularly review the IPS
When properly executed, a plan’s IPS is a good risk management tool. It is also one of the first documents that plaintiffs’ attorneys will look at. As such, plan committees should review their IPS with their consultant and attorney at least annually or on a quarterly basis.
Having committee members who miss meetings
Within committee meetings, fiduciaries are responsible for identifying issues and evaluating important information to jointly make decisions. If one member of the committee fails to participate, he or she has breached their fiduciary duty and endangered the remaining committee members. 
Focusing on costs at the expense of quality
Plan committees can actually become too focused on costs to the point that their decisions compromise the quality of the investments and services being offered to participants. The law doesn’t say that investments or services need to be inexpensive, but rather reasonably priced.

Receiving benefits from the plan service providers
There are occasions where consultants or recordkeepers will attempt to provide services to the employer or committee members for free or at a discounted price. This practice is strictly prohibited. As a practical matter, the money that pays for the free or discounted services comes from the plan, and the money in the plan belongs to the participants — not to the company or the committee.
Read more about ways for plan committees to avoid these fiduciary mistakes.

Student loans have become the fastest-growing segment of US household debt, surpassing credit cards to become the largest source of personal debt outside of mortgages.1 Seven in 10 college graduates have student loans, and the average person leaves school $30,000 in arrears. Nearly 20% owe more than $100,000.2 Consequently, this debt has a major effect on people’s ability to save for the future; by age 30, graduates with student loans have accumulated 50% less retirement wealth than those without student loan debt.3

As employees of all ages struggle to save for retirement due to compounding student debt,1  a growing number of employers are offering innovative student loan benefits, with the added bonus of increasing recruitment and retention of highly skilled workers in a tightening labor market.
What can plan sponsors do?
In addition to extending financial wellness education focused on managing overall debt, some employers offer access to student loan refinancing options that may provide better terms or rates. The latest consideration is the addition of loan management platforms — where a company provides contributions toward an employee’s student loan debt — with assessment tools available to offer guidance around consolidation, refinancing, and repayment. Employers eager to retain and attract key employees are exploring the two categories within loan management platforms: student loan direct payment programs and student loan 401(k) match programs.
In this article, we focus on the legislative efforts and other considerations of student loan management platforms, as well as creative approaches by several early-adopter employers.

Key takeaways
The pandemic has driven a demand for cash
Companies and governments both required greater liquidity.
The Fed has struggled with volatility
Despite pulling all available levers, the Fed has had trouble stabilizing the US Treasury market.
Banks and broker-dealers are a kink in the supply chain
Banks have not been able to speedily disperse liquidity, forcing the Fed to create special facilities.

As the coronavirus made its presence known across the globe, governments, companies, and individuals struggled to ascertain what the real impact would, and should, mean to their respective businesses and lives. Uncertainty led to volatile markets, with equity and fixed income markets showing signs of stress asearly as mid-February — ultimately prompting the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to implement an inter-meeting interest rate cut of 50 basis points on March 3.
Unfortunately, the risk-off tone continued, leading to elevated demand for cash and US dollars. Companies needed more cash on hand to meet payroll and other obligations as their businesses were put on hold, while local, state, and federal governments needed more cash to pay for new fiscal policies launched to offset the economic impact of the virus. Meanwhile, individuals withdrew from risk markets as volatility increased and their risk appetite waned.
Through March, the Fed continued to pull all the levers at its disposal, including repurchase agreement(repo) operations and open market purchases, to try to add liquidity to the system and stabilize what was becoming a volatile and illiquid US Treasury market. The Fed also announced a large-scale asset purchase program, enhanced US dollar swap lines with foreign central banks(including a reduced rate charged to access theselines), and implemented other measures to encourage banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to help restore market functioning.
Despite the Fed’s willingness and ability to pump trillions into the market, it struggled to get liquidity into the hands of those who needed it. Following the global financial crisis, banks and broker-dealers have become a kink in the liquidity supply chain, and working through them was not enough to disperse the needed liquidity through the system.The Fed and the US Treasury had to act quickly to create new facilities and bring back old ones from 2008.

Helping employees prepare for rising health care costs has been a rallying cry for years. It’s no wonder, then, that the retirement industry has focused its attention on health savings accounts (HSAs) as part of an increased emphasis on holistic financial wellness. Used in conjunction with an employee’s defined contribution (DC) plan assets, applying HSA funds to cover medical expenses can be a powerful combined retirement strategy.
Available only with high deductible health plans (HDHP), HSAs give both employers and employees an evolved strategy to help manage ever-increasing health care costs, now and in the future. HSAs allow tax-free contributions, gains, and withdrawals to cover qualified medical expenses and, most importantly, the ability to invest those assets for health care expenses in retirement.

MOSERS, a $2.1 billion plan with 65,000 participants,1 has a participation rate of 78% (up from 60% in 2007) and offers a lineup of 14 funds (consisting of 13 custom target date funds and one stable value fund). 
Every year, the plan sends out a comprehensive “Retirement and Savings” survey to three different age cohorts, eliciting feedback on how education efforts can be improved. For further data, they test subject lines for each of the cohorts over the course of a month, using Amazon gift cards and other small prizes to increase survey response rates.

The first half of this year has been dominated by the spreading coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing policy response. The latter has been overwhelming; both monetary and fiscal policy are fully engaged in developed countries while monetary policy is leading the charge in emerging markets. This immense policy response has been well-documented, and its impact on markets has removed almost all of the funding and balance sheet-related risk premia that were built into valuations in March.
The impact of policy is best seen in the development of the path of inflation expectations in the US. Over the course of the second quarter, five-year real yields in the US fell by 60 basis points, while nominal yields fell by 10 basis points, leading to an increase in inflation expectations of 50 basis points.¹ It remains our belief that real yields will need to rally further and inflation expectations will need to increase for risk assets to continue performing.
Other assets that have benefited most have been, as expected, the ones on which the central banks have focused. Risk and liquidity premia have largely been removed from assets such as US investment grade, the European periphery, and emerging market rates. Other assets — such as emerging market high yield — have seen a significant reduction in liquidity premia, but a smaller reduction in economic risk. The change in liquidity and funding dynamics has been best reflected in the US dollar. Its rapid ascent was quickly halted and reversed in the second quarter, with the broad US dollar index (BBDXY) ending the quarter nearly 2% lower.1

Specifically in the real estate sector, the pandemic has created short-term stresses in the capital markets and to listed real estate. However, real estate at its core is a long-term investment, and with expected drops in inflation, interest rates and growth rate, the income return from real estate may offer stability in an uncertain time.
A halt on economic activity
Under normal conditions, investors look to the health of the economy as a guide to real estate demand. This is difficult to do right now with the current level of uncertainty. At this stage, no one knows how long the pandemic will last, or if current policy responses will be effective. In the real estate sector as a whole, demand has been interrupted in the short term, and there is a good chance it will be diminished for an extended period. 
Recovery scenarios
The shape of the pandemic recovery cycle remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: The longer the pandemic lasts, the deeper the economic impacts will be. At the start of the crisis, the global real estate market was fundamentally sound, demand was strong, and rents were expected to increase in 2020. But now, with many tenants in crisis mode, market-level rents are in flux.

Helping employees prepare for rising health care costs has been a rallying cry for years. It’s no wonder, then, that the retirement industry has focused its attention on health savings accounts (HSAs) as part of an increased emphasis on holistic financial wellness. Used in conjunction with an employee’s defined contribution (DC) plan assets, applying HSA funds to cover medical expenses can be a powerful combined retirement strategy.
Available only with high deductible health plans (HDHP), HSAs give both employers and employees an evolved strategy to help manage ever-increasing health care costs, now and in the future. HSAs allow tax-free contributions, gains, and withdrawals to cover qualified medical expenses, and — most importantly — the ability to invest those assets for health care expenses in retirement.
In addition to encouraging employees to take more responsibility for their health care spending, employers are also offering HSAs to expand their benefits package for increased recruitment and retention efforts. As a result, the number of accounts and assets have risen year-over-year since their creation in 2003, with total assets projected to increase to more than $90 billion, held by 30 million accounts, by the end of 2021.1

Key takeaways
The 2020 debates are kicking off
The first debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will take place on Sept. 29.
Coronavirus concerns are front and center
Top of mind is the US’ fight against COVID-19, along with both candidates’ plans regarding how they would engage with China.
We’re watching to see how each candidate prioritizes their platform
Ultimately, we want to hear what their top legislative priorities are, as the top one or two are the only ones likely to become law.

The first debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will take place on Sept. 29 — the first of three debates scheduled to take place before Election Day on Nov. 3. The first debate in an election season leaves an indelible impression on voters, especially in regard to the challenger. And often, this impression has nothing to do with substance on the issues and everything to do with optics and presentation. In short, Biden needs to show voters that he is strong enough and competent enough to hold the office. How he presents side-by-side with Trump will be determinative, in our view.
For the economy and markets, however, substance does matter. Below are some of the issues that we hope to see addressed in these events.
Critical issues to watch
COVID-19. Top of mind is the US’ fight against COVID-19. In a recent town hall, Trump suggested he might pursue a “herd immunity” strategy if there is another resurgence of the virus.1 In contrast, Biden has suggested that if recommended by medical experts, he would be open to implementing another widescale lockdown similar to the one experienced last spring. We will be listening for the candidates to confirm their preferred responses to the virus, as well as any further details about each candidate’s plans to combat any future resurgence in the virus. Countries such as South Korea have been very effective in tamping down the virus through the implementation of a strong contact tracing infrastructure, and by rapidly implementing targeted lockdowns when cases rise. It will be interesting to see if Biden proposes something similar. Will responses be targeted or broad? Will responses be driven by the federal government, or by the states? Will the federal government create a robust contact tracing infrastructure? These approaches have the potential to significantly impact economic activity. In addition, as vaccine trials progress, it’s important to hear how a potential vaccine would be distributed to the population. 
China. We will be very focused on both candidates’ plans regarding how they would engage with China. The Trump administration’s approach has created significant volatility in markets, and there is fear that a second term would mean even more erratic and aggressive moves against China. We want to hear what the president has to say about his plans — would he continue to pursue a unilateral and disruptive approach if re-elected? On the other hand, there is greater uncertainty about what a Biden administration might mean for the US-China relationship. In our view, there are two main possibilities: One is that a Biden presidency would hit the “reset” button on relations with China, while another is that Biden would continue to be aggressive with China, but in a more measured and multilateral way. Neither of these approaches would be disruptive to markets, in our view, and even thought the latter may cause some concerns, a multilateral approach might be more effective (and be a step toward globalization) than pursuing a unilateral approach, as Trump has done.
Taxes. Perhaps the biggest fear for markets vis-à-vis a Biden presidency is the potential for taxes to increase. We want to hear which taxes in the Biden tax plan he is committed to implementing, and whether or not the state of the economy will impact his timing: He plans to raise taxes, but when? If he decides to raise taxes immediately, will it be corporate or household or both? If household taxes are increased, would it only be for the wealthiest Americans? Clearly the economic recovery is still very fragile, so raising taxes next year could be problematic, in our view.
Infrastructure. This is one area that both candidates have said they would spend more on, but we haven’t gotten much in the way of details. It would be good to hear what each candidate’s infrastructure spending plan is, including the amount they plan to spend on infrastructure, how it will be financed, and perhaps even when it might be implemented. In the 1930s, government spending on infrastructure was used as a way to fight unemployment and put people back to work, and it was successful in reducing unemployment and helping the economy. Might the same be true going forward?
Other topics to watch
In addition to the topics above, we believe the following issues may have a potential impact on markets and investor portfolios:

Technology. Technology is an area of confusion for investors. Both candidates seem interested in regulating technology — but in different areas. Will that be a priority for either one? This may be important for tech investors to know. 
Health care. Similarly, there is confusion around what each candidate plans in terms of health care. Both of them appear to be interested in lowering pharmaceutical prices. But the key questions that we have are: 1) What is Trump’s plan for a substitute for the Affordable Care Act (ACA)? 2) Will Biden seek to rebuild and strengthen the ACA, or will he pursue a Medicare For All strategy? The answers to these questions may have significant implications for health care.

Climate change. This debate is taking place as wildfires rage in California and Oregon, and the Gulf Coast seeks to recover from the impact of Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Sally. Notably, the National Hurricane Center has run out of approved names for storms this season, meaning that future storms will be named after letters in the Greek alphabet — the first time this has happened since 2005. This puts climate change in the spotlight. How will the candidates address this issue, particularly in regard to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement (which Trump withdrew from, and Biden has pledged to rejoin)? This of course has serious economic implications for the short and longer term.

Conclusion
We recognize that every four years, each candidate rolls out a platform with a wide variety of proposed initiatives. This can create shorter-term volatility in specific sectors that would be impacted by these plans. However, it is important to note that usually only a few signature policies typically come to fruition and become law. So, while we hope to hear details on all of the issues above, it will be just as critical to hear how each candidate plans to prioritize their platform. We want to hear what their top legislative priorities are, as the top one or two are the only ones likely to become law.

Key takeaways
US voters turn out in record numbers
Donald Trump received more votes than any candidate in history except for Joe Biden, the next president of the United States.
Attention turns to the fight for the Senate Majority
The prospects for Biden’s ambitious agenda depend on two runoffs which Democrats will need to sweep to produce a 50-50 Senate.

While it will take weeks or months to fully deconstruct and analyze the results of this month’s election, we know enough to say that the voters have yet again delivered a nuanced verdict.
President Donald J. Trump received more votes than any candidate in history except for Joe Biden, the next president of the United States. Estimates project that more than 150 million Americans will have voted once all the ballots are counted - a 65%+ turnout percentage1 not seen since 1960 and possibly much further back in our history. Within this historic turnout, Trump defied conventional wisdom and made double-digit gains with the Hispanic electorate while some 19 million “new voters” entered the fray and broke for Biden by a 2-1 margin.
The harsh judgement of the incumbent, however, did not carry down ballot in any meaningful way. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to flip the GOP Senate and key state legislatures to Democratic hands but resulted in a near-total failure. Not a single state legislature flipped control from red to blue, and while there were countless stories in the runup to the election about the trends in Texas, not a single state seat went from Republican to Democratic either.
How did Biden cut against this state-level tide of GOP support? By recapturing the Midwest “Blue Wall” and making inroads in recent GOP sources of strength in Arizona and Georgia. If the 2016 Electoral College victory for Trump (306 votes) was defined by 107,000 votes in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, the 2020 Electoral College victory for Biden (likely 306 votes) was defined by just 93,000 votes in Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. As evidenced in yet another election, the United States electorate remains evenly divided in spite of predictions that demographic evolutions will kill the Republican party. The election highlighted that voters can and will split tickets, candidates matter, and, as is often the case in a presidential election, this was a referendum contest.

Key takeaways
I believe we should expect more of the same in Q1
We haven’t yet turned the page on all the difficulties of the past year.
The pressure is on for the US, Canada, and the eurozone
Recent economic data reflects the damage being wrought by the rise in COVID-19 infections.
I believe a better Spring is ahead
By this spring, I believe “Groundhog Year” will be over and headwinds will abate.

Weekly Market Compass: The economy may not truly turn the page until spring
It might be 2021, but it doesn’t feel like a new year in many parts of the world. We haven’t yet turned the page on all the difficulties of the past year, so it seems like we are stuck in 2020. Or as my colleague aptly put it, this is just Dec. 49, 2020.
Vaccinations moving slowly in many parts of the world

Let’s start with COVID-19. Things aren’t getting better globally in terms of controlling the virus. The US and the UK look particularly challenged. And the holiday season could have been one giant superspreader event for those who did not stay isolated. Germany has had record daily COVID-19 infections — and deaths — for the last several weeks. Even Pope Francis’ personal physician died last week of the virus.
There is also less progress than expected on the distribution of vaccines in numerous countries. France has vaccinated only 0.29 per 100 people, while Germany has vaccinated only 0.82 per 100 people and Canada has vaccinated 1.03 per 100 people.1 Spain has vaccinated only 1.04 per 100 people and the US has vaccinated only 2.82 per 100 people, while the UK has vaccinated 4.19 per 100 people.1 We can all learn from Israel, which has vaccinated 22.34 per 100 people, helped by a digitized universal health care system, a widespread ad campaign, and good planning, purchasing doses early on in order to cover the entire population.1 That so many countries have made so little progress is concerning because medical experts estimate that 55.6% to 81.5% of the total population should be vaccinated in order to bring an end to COVID-19.2
Economic data shows continued pressure
Recent economic data has shown signs of the damage being wrought by the rise in COVID-19 infections. The December jobs reports for both the US and Canada were disappointing, as were last week’s US initial jobless claims. We also saw weakness in US retail sales for December.
As for the eurozone economy, it also came under pressure in December. As Chris Williamson of IHS Markit explained, “The eurozone economy contracted for a second successive month in December, deteriorating at a slightly faster rate than previously thought at the end of the year due to intensifying COVID-19 infections.”3
I would expect economic data to continue to show weakness in the next several months as the virus continues to spread.
Stimulus talk didn’t help US stocks last week
Also last week, US President-elect Joe Biden released details of his $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposal, titled “The American Rescue and Recovery Plan.” But the market reaction was different than what we saw with past tranches of stimulus, with stocks selling off. Some suggested it could be that expectations of stimulus were already baked into stocks while others placed the blame on his talk of taxes. I think his discussion of raising taxes is responsible, sending US stocks lower on Friday. It also served as a reminder of all the additional spending many countries have done and the accompanying debt they have taken on to combat COVID-19, and the significant consequences.
More of the same for Q1?
And so I think we should expect more of the same for the next several months. I suspect the first quarter of 2021 will really just be the fifth quarter of 2020, with continued headwinds for many economies. I worry about some risks:

COVID-19. I talked about slow progress with vaccinations. What’s worse are the variants of the virus that have emerged. Medical experts are not sure whether current vaccines will protect against these recent variants. Doctors believe that the vaccines are effective against the far more contagious UK variant (which is projected to become the dominant strain of the virus in the US by March) — but there are no widespread studies to support that belief yet. And there is more concern that the South African variant may not be protected against by current vaccines. Even if the vaccines do protect against all these variants, I worry that these more contagious strains will cause an even bigger increase in infections, hospitalizations and deaths — and an even bigger decrease in economic activity — in the next several months before vaccines are broadly distributed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is so worried about these COVID mutations that she has alerted lawmakers that the country should remain in lockdown until early April, explaining, “If we don’t manage to stop this British virus, then we will have 10 times the number of cases by Easter. We need eight to 10 more weeks of tough measures.”4
Distribution headwinds. Various countries are running into distribution glitches related to supply and infrastructure. Many emerging markets countries don’t have enough supply of the vaccine, as wealthier countries have bought up the vaccines. Some developed countries may not have enough supply either. In the US, President-elect Joe Biden last week announced an ambitious plan to vaccinate 100 million Americans in his first 100 days in office by building out a strong federal infrastructure, utilizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Guard. However, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced last week that there is no vaccine stockpile left in the US, which could slow down those vaccine plans. I wouldn’t be surprised to see more distribution hiccups in many countries in the next several months.

There is also one risk specific to markets: the potential for monetary policy to tighten more quickly than expected — or, to be more accurate, investors worrying that monetary policy will tighten more quickly than expected. This concern is centered on the Federal Reserve (Fed), given trepidation that stimulus might actually push inflation higher and force the Fed’s hand.
Admittedly, there have been a few Fed officials who have made comments recently that could cause indigestion for investors on a sugar high from ultra-low rates. However, last week Fed Chair Jay Powell tried to assuage fears about tightening, saying that the Fed would be very careful in communicating about any changes in policy and that the Fed would avoid premature tightening. He explained that “(One) lesson of the global financial crisis is: be careful not to exit too early” and that central bankers shouldn’t even try to discuss exiting “because the markets are already listening.”5
Yes, markets are listening because there is so much worry about this topic. For the record, I continue to believe it is unlikely we see inflation spike substantially — but it remains an investor concern. I think markets could swoon on just words alone — or, to put it more accurately, just misinterpreting words.
A light at the end of the tunnel?

I must stress that I believe there is a very bright light at the end of the tunnel. We just need to make it through the next few months. In other words, I believe we will be able to turn the page.
By this spring, I believe “Groundhog Year” will be over and headwinds will abate. I expect markets to continue to move in expectations of a robust recovery later in 2021 when vaccines are broadly distributed. That should benefit cyclical stocks, emerging market stocks (especially in Asia), and commodities that are sensitive to the economic cycle, especially energy and industrial metals. I do expect tech to continue to perform well, given that many of the trends that accelerated during the pandemic may not reverse. As always, I believe investors should be prudent, which means maintaining a well-diversified portfolio to help lower overall volatility, which is a likely risk in this environment.

Key takeaways
The pandemic has accelerated the rise of robotics
Despite the rise in unemployment, the move to automation is continuing because it brings value.
Robots can complement the work done by humans
Work that is too dangerous, dirty, dull, or dear may benefit from automation.
Automation has been a structural trend for centuries
We see this accelerating in the age of COVID-19, as robots aren't affected by the pandemic.

Like many other trends, the shift to automation, and the use of robotics, has accelerated during the global pandemic. Even though unemployment has risen dramatically, particularly in the US, the move to automation is continuing because of the value it brings. Robots can complement work done by humans or perform tasks humans would prefer not to because the work falls into one of the four D’s — dangerous, dirty, dull, or dear (as in expensive.)
At home and at work
Who will be our future companions at work and at home? Hunter-Gatherers accepted grey wolves into their tribes 15,000 years ago, and this domestication process has led to the pets we know as dogs today. These wolves were additive to the tribe, as their superior sense of smell increased the productivity of hunting, with the added benefit of being able to detect strangers in the vicinity. But can you imagine the committee meetings about this idea? ""We’re going to bring vicious predators into our tribes that we have to feed with part of our hunting haul, all good?"" The productivity and security benefits outweighed these concerns, and clearly this partnership between human and wolf has proven to be successful.
Like welcoming a wolf into your tribe, many people may have some trepidations about bringing a robot into their home. As time goes on, however, people are starting to see the benefits of getting some mechanical help at home. iRobot’s Roomba, the vacuum-cleaning robot, was the first such machine than many people welcomed under their roof. Since its release in 2002, iRobot has steadily improved the quality and navigational capabilities of each successive generation of Roomba and has built a nice market share in the vacuum industry. Vacuuming is certainly a dull, repetitive task, and people clearly value having a robot keep their floors clean.
While the company experienced some challenges because its manufacturing plants had been shut down during the early days of the crisis, demand for the Roomba increased because people are at home more, creating more dirt in the house. iRobot also now has a product that does mopping — the Braava. They have also developed Terra, a lawnmowing robot, though that launch was delayed because of the disruption of the current pandemic.
The pandemic has increased the number of jobs that are seen as dangerous. There have been reports of large outbreaks of the virus in meat processing plants, for instance. Tyson Foods has been testing robots in some of their plants and have highlighted advancements in robustness and robotic vision as reasons that robots may be able to help in their meat plants. Meat processing requires a lot of washing and disinfecting steps, which older robots could not withstand.    

Two of the companies in the Invesco Oppenheimer Global Opportunities Fund has contributed to advances in computer vision, Basler and Cognex. Basler makes small, robust, and high-precision cameras that can be integrated into robots as well as placed around factories for security and monitoring uses. Cognex has advanced software that analyzes the information acquired by cameras. This allows fast inspection of parts that are being manufactured, and allows robots to deal with non-standardized shapes, such as animal carcasses.  
The automotive industry has led the way in automating production, as for certain tasks where the robots see identical parts and require identical motions every time, older generations of robots could function quite well. But these older robots may not do so well with more complicated tasks, such as sorting through a box of nuts and bolts and being able to grasp a bolt no matter the orientation in the box. Yaskawa Electric makes robots with the finer motor skills needed for this task. Yaskawa robots have a delicate enough touch to grasp strawberries and place them on top of cakes.
The increased precision of robots and factory automation has led to more industries adopting them. The semiconductor industry has taken to using more robots in their inline processing of chips. Moving silicon wafers requires extreme precision, with as little vibration as possible. Any defect in the production steps can ruin a wafer full of semiconductor chips, each possibly costing tens of thousands of dollars. THK is the leader in linear motion guides, tools that can enable robotic arms or machines parts to move in swinging arcs or straight lines and stop exactly when needed to perform delicate, precise tasks.
Nidec is the leader in small motors, historically used in hard disk drives and home appliances. Today, they are finding more uses for these in robots and factory automation. These motors need to produce smooth motion without jerks. Nidec has also started production of reduction gears, which function as robot joints, and are essential for smooth movement and precision stopping action with no spring-back motion.
Core to our investment philosophy is to seek out big changes going on in the world, and then invest in the industries and individual companies that can benefit the most from these changes. The increasing prevalence of automation and robotics has been a consistent feature of the global economy since the industrial revolution, and the very first attempts at mechanizing laundry in the late 1700’s.  We see this structural trend being accelerated in the age of COVID-19, as robots can navigate through the world untroubled by fears of a pandemic. In addition, facilitating the rise of automation has been recent advancements in the area of cognitive assistance, but that is a topic for another day. Stay tuned for more!

Key takeaways
Health care stocks may offer a long-term potential
Health care does not dominate the market like big tech, but it offers investors valuable long-term opportunity potential.
Health care has five potential benefits for investors
From earnings growth opportunities to favorable demographics, health care offers long-term potential.
DWA Healthcare Momentum ETF
Investors looking to capture trends in the health care sector may want to examine the Invesco DWA Healthcare Momentum ETF (PTH).

When thinking about growth, many investors default to technology, noting companies like Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, and Facebook have changed the world by drastically altering how we live and work. In fact, in the two years ending June 30, 2020, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, and Google accounted for 56% of the return in the S&P 500.1  However, fewer investors think of health care as a sector with similar potential to generate growth.
Health care presents the opportunity to invest in companies that are constantly innovating to improve quality of life and raise productivity. It is hard to put a value on vaccines, cancer drugs, joint replacements, and pacemakers. At the same time, health care names do not dominate the market like big tech. Johnson and Johnson (1.46%) and United Healthcare (1.07%) are the two largest health care firms in the S&P 500, but at a combined 2.53% they have less influence than Alphabet. (By way of comparison, Alphabet’s A and C shares account for 3.36% of the S&P 500.)
Despite its underrepresentation in the S&P 500 relative to technology, I believe health care continues to offer investors valuable long-term opportunity potential. Here are five reasons why.
1.  Health care offers the potential for strong earnings growth. In the five years through March 31, 2020, profit growth in the S&P 1500 health care sector rose at a compounded annual rate of 8.1%. This pace of earnings growth was nearly 3.5x faster than that of the entire S&P 1500 (2.4%), and the third-fastest sector growth rate behind information technology (9.9%) and financials (8.6%).2 Looking at growth potential from another angle, prescription drug spending rose at a 9.1% annualized rate between 2000 and 2018, underscoring the underlying demand for health care.
2.  Health care is a play on demographics and an aging population. Since 2000, the US population over 65 years of age has grown 62%, which equates to a 2.5% annualized compounded rate. Over the next 10 years, the US Census Bureau projects the population over 65 rising another 30%, which equals a 2.6% annualized compounded rate.3 Older populations are likely to spend more on health care as their bodies mature, and medical care is needed to maintain their well-being.
3.  The pandemic sheds light on the importance of health care to national security. COVID-19 highlights the potential of a virus to shut down economic activity, potentially contribute to social instability, and hinder national defense; after all, it’s hard to fight a war if the troops are sick. As a result, government policy is more likely to be friendly toward health care companies that have the resources and know how to innovate and combat the health care issues which threaten society. There is plenty of risk of policy change with an election around the corner, but it will be hard (or at least harder) for politicians to demonize and over-regulate companies that are contributing to national security, while working to solve the health care problems of the day.
4.  Medtech offers the ability to blend technology with health care and drive future growth. Medtech has opened a new opportunity for health care beyond the traditional pharmacy, insurance, facility, and device industries present in the health care sector. Medtech improves the delivery and usage of health care products and services using concepts like artificial intelligence, digitization, robotics, monitoring devices, and 3D printing. It provides a new frontier for the health care sector and investors.
5.  Health care earnings have the potential to hold up in economic downturns, while displaying less volatility. The S&P 500 health care sector has demonstrated earnings growth during periods where earnings for the S&P 500 have contracted. The following table displays the cyclical contraction in 12-month trailing earnings per share (EPS) for the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Health Care Index. 12-month trailing EPS for the S&P 500 declined by an average of 27.1% during the three pre-pandemic earnings recessions. In contrast, S&P 500 Health Care Index earnings rose by an average of 14.2% during the same time periods. The current earnings recession is ongoing, but data shows a similar pattern.

Key takeaways
History warns against leaving the market during uncertain times
Data shows that it’s time in the market that matters rather than timing the market.
Election uncertainty offers investing opportunities
Potential drawdowns resulting from the uncertainty of the election may present a buying opportunity.

Investors continue to ask me if they should get out of the market to “sit out this election.” I’ve attempted to push back against this impulse by using long-term historical perspectives to remind investors that, as always, it’s time in the market that matters rather than timing the market. In my last article, I represented that investors’ long-term returns would have been meaningfully diminished had they sat out the first 100 days following each of the inaugurations over the past 60-plus years.

The response to that article had many inquiring, not about the first 100 days of a term, but rather about the performance of markets in the weeks leading up to the election. Here are the results. The average and the median returns are positive — modestly better if you exclude the 2008 global financial crisis.1

You likely know someone that you run into regularly at social events who you believe would be a great client. But you’ve never ""found the right opportunity"" to broach the subject or you’re waiting for that person to approach you (since he/ she obviously knows what you do and would say something if he/she had an interest). Your reluctance is based on fear: your fear of coming across like a ""pushy salesperson"" and his/her fear of being rejected by you. I know what you are thinking: ""Wait a minute, I understand the first one, but the second one ... no way!"" (More on that later.) The next time you run into your ""social relationship,"" find the appropriate time to say the following:
""Mary, you know we run into each other all the time at these social events, and I just want you to know something: If you ever have any financial or investment questions, or need a second opinion, I would be happy to make myself and my team available to you. However, our friendship is far more important to me than any business relationship we might ever develop, so I will rely on you to reach out to me, if and when that need arises. I just want you to know that the door is always open to you. So, with that in mind, 'How 'bout them Cowboys?'""
Again, feel free to play around with the language. However, just be sure to maintain the two key concepts of ""second opinion"" and ""the door is always open to you."" Now, back to the fear of being rejected by you. You must understand how you are perceived in your community. Many of you have been extraordinarily successful in an industry that is both fascinating and mysterious to those on the outside looking in. People often see you (contrary to the characterization in the popular press) as a hybrid of Milton Friedman and Warren Buffett and assume you are given a stable of well-heeled, white-gloved clients to work with.
Consider this true story from a financial professional who learned the hard way:
A number of years ago, we were speaking on this very issue to a group of around 150 financial professionals. When we concluded, an individual in the back of the room yelled out, ""Where were you six months ago?"" To which we responded, ""We don't remember what we had for lunch yesterday, so where we were six months ago is a long-lost memory. Why?"" He then went on to tell the following story:
""Six months ago, I was playing golf with one of my best friends from childhood, who was both my college roommate and the best man at my wedding. As we approached the first tee, he said, 'Since I'm now contributing to the financial health of your firm, this round's on you.' I, of course, asked what he was talking about. He said that he became a client of my firm a couple of weeks ago. I said, 'What?' He said there was a financial professional with whom he was impressed that worked for my firm and had been talking to him on and off for the last couple of years; and that heck, if the firm was good enough for me to work with over the last 15 years, it should be good enough for him to help with his investments. After I recovered from that punch in the gut, I asked him, 'Why hadn't you approached me?' He said that he assumed I was 'full' and not taking on any new clients. If I had this script six months ago, I would more than likely have my best friend (who was quite wealthy, I might add) as a client. I just didn't know how to frame the message in such a way that it didn't look totally self-serving and as though I was trading on our friendship. I will never allow that to happen again!""

Key takeaways
Attract and Retain Talent
Team members must be given the opportunities to grow and develop personally, professionally and economically
Foster Productivity and Loyalty
Intentionally plan Semiannual Developmental Meeting Questions on an individual and team basis

The development and performance of the team collectively reflects the development and performance of the team members individually. To attract and retain great people, it is our view that team members must be given the opportunities to grow and develop personally, professionally and economically. If they don't find opportunities within the team, they will likely seek it outside the team. Below is a list of concepts that, when present, may foster both productivity and loyalty.
Semiannual Developmental Meeting Overview:

These meetings are between one of the senior partners and an individual junior partner or senior staff member.
For larger teams, the Chief of Staff conducts these one-on-one meetings with individual staff members.
These meetings should be conducted in a relaxed and casual setting, preferably over lunch.
The focus of the meeting is the accomplishments, developmental opportunities, and career aspirations of the junior person.
Look for the intersection of the individual's aspirations, his/her talents and skills and the team's current and future needs.
Obtain the individual's unique insights and perspective on the team's current strengths and weaknesses.

Semiannual Developmental Meeting Questions: Team Insights
What are the best things we currently do for our clients?
What could we stop doing that our clients wouldn't miss?
What could we add that would enhance our relationship and impact with our clientele?
What are our greatest strengths as a functioning team?
What do we need to do better to improve our ability to function and grow as a team?
What do I need to do to be a better partner/leader?
Semiannual Developmental Meeting Questions: Individual Insights
What are the three things you enjoy most about your job? Why?
What are the three things you enjoy least about your job? Why?
What could be added to your job to make it more satisfying, interesting, and fulfilling?
How could we mitigate, automate or delegate those things you enjoy the least?
Is there anything you're struggling with right now?
What education, training and/or experience do you need to get to the next level in your career?
What would you like to be doing personally and professionally in the next three to five years?

Evaluate your clientele for possible centers of influence.
One day, a financial professional we know was analyzing his practice and noticed that he was beginning to build a fairly significant presence in the local medical community, among doctors generally, and surgeons specifically. He then asked what turned out to be two very important questions about his practice: What is it about the medical profession in general and surgeons in particular that is so attractive to him, and how could he more effectively grow his practice within this particular niche market? The result of this thought process resulted in the following script, which he tried out on a physician that was not only a good client but a great friend. He scheduled a lunch meeting the following week under the premise of wanting to pick the physician's brain regarding the direction he wanted to take his practice. They met for lunch the following week and after a few pleasantries, the financial professional said the following:
""Hey Bill, as I said on the phone, I stumbled upon something as I was analyzing my practice on which I need your insight. I really appreciate your taking the time to allow me to pick your brain. I noticed that over 30% of my clientele are physicians, with a fairly large percentage being surgeons. I knew I worked with a number of doctors, but this number surprised me. As I thought about why this was occurring, I came up with a couple of interesting insights. I think the first catalyst was my mom, who, like many mothers, hoped her little boy would grow up one day to be a doctor. To plant that seed she bought me a book entitled, The Making of a Surgeon,1 by William A. Nolen, published by Random House (1970). (at this point, Bill stopped me and said that was his favorite book about his profession and that he, too, had read it as a young boy), about a young doctor going through his internship and residency at the famed Bellevue Hospital in New York. Dr. Nolen's journey was so captivating that I decided that I, too, would become a surgeon.
""I later ran up against my lack of affinity for math and science, but as you know, Bill, I never lost my fascination with and respect for your profession. My second discovery was how much I enjoyed working with surgeons temperamentally. I have discovered over the years I work best with individuals who are extremely decisive. People who continually vacillate and equivocate drive me to distraction. Surgeons seem to be temperamentally wired to make tough decisions with the best information available and appear to continually move forward toward the best result. Being wired that way myself makes us, in my mind, a great fit.
""So, with my affinity for both the profession and the practitioner, I decided that I wanted to consciously grow my practice much more in this arena. And, as I thought about the best way to do that, I realized something: I could never know as much about your profession as you do, Bill. So, here's my question: If you were me (and you know me and my business model as well as anyone), how would you more consciously and systematically attract more surgeons into your practice? What would you do?""
At this point, say nothing, and let your client talk.
And here's how the story ended. His physician friend thought for a moment, smiled, and said, ""Well the first thing I would do is take me to lunch on Wednesdays."" The financial professional responded somewhat quizzically, ""You know I always enjoy lunch with you, Bill ... but why?"" He said, ""Well, every Wednesday, a number of my colleagues and I meet for lunch down here. On any given week, there could be anywhere from five to 15 of us sitting around just shooting the breeze, telling war stories, complaining about the bureaucracy. Basically we've become an informal support group.
""These are exactly the kind of men and women that fit your profile. So, here's what we should do: the next Wednesday you find yourself in the neighborhood, give me a heads-up, and you can join us for lunch. I'll simply tell everyone that I was meeting with my financial professional and asked you to join us for lunch. The rest is up to you."" He, of course, said, ""How does next Wednesday look?"" The friend laughed, and said, ""That would be great."" It went off just as anticipated. He introduced the financial professional, and because he was the new kid on the block, he was the center of both attention and conversation.

The bottom line is that the financial professional would never have considered this approach without the direct insight and guidance of his physician friend.

Key takeaways
In tough times, let your clients steer the conversation
Savvy financial professionals allow the emotions of their clients to guide conversations.
Forget the Fed
The least effective thing you can begin with is talking about the market.
A client-centric approach is key
We share two strategies designed to demonstrate your value and earn client trust.

Emotions can be messy. In the midst of difficulty, it may be tempting to fall back on numbers and spreadsheets when talking to clients precisely to avoid bringing emotions into play. However, in our experience, in challenging times, it’s more important than ever to let emotions into the conversation.
We’re all facing an uncertain path forward as COVID-19 and social injustice concerns continue to evolve. To address tough situations, we’ve found that the highest-performing financial professionals meet their clients where they are, allowing client emotions as well as their particular financial and life circumstances to guide conversations rather than focusing on general market conditions or short-term reactions to the news.
In our experience, in any difficult situation, if you're talking to a client, probably the least effective thing you can begin with is talking about the market or the latest move from the Federal Reserve (Fed). That's what we all are tempted to do because that's what we do with one another within the financial services profession. However, when clients are fearful or anxious, it’s almost as if they can’t actually hear you. Our team finds itself returning to this theme now more than ever as we provide financial professionals with tools designed to help you connect with clients more deeply, more quickly, and more effectively.
We at Invesco Global Consulting have spent countless hours working on optimizing communication methods for different scenarios. Here, we’ll focus on two strategies that we have found can make a significant difference during a crisis. There are two easy acronyms we suggest to financial professionals: AAA and M.A.I.N.
The AAA strategy
The AAA or “Triple A” acronym is one we have collaborated on with certified business coach and clinical psychologist Dr. Tim Ursiny. Triple A — a method of responding to clients — stands for:

Acknowledge: Reflect what clients are saying. Give them a chance to vent — to express themselves — an opportunity that clients don’t get too often. Doing this may help normalize a client’s concerns, potentially minimizing the control their worries exert.
Agree: Find some aspect, even if it’s a small part of what your client has said, with which you can agree. Think of it as the 1/100 rule; identify 1% of what your client has said and agree with it 100%. It’s important that you genuinely agree with it; this will help create a connection. It’s hard to be upset with someone who agrees with you!
Add: This is where you provide additional information (historical context, analysis, observations, and facts) in an effort to help alleviate their concerns. From using a simple framework to explain complicated ideas to finding cultural references that your client responds to, this also, in our experience, helps to build a dialogue based on personal connection.

The M.A.I.N. approach
You can also use the M.A.I.N. approach in an effort to showcase your value to clients. This strategy employs four key words — Monitor, Adjust, Inform, and Navigate — to help communicate the value financial professionals aim to provide to clients. Particularly during times of uncertainty, we have found that these words can be useful tools for financial professionals to help communicate that they are attuned to what’s happening in their clients' worlds and stand ready to correct course as needed. We have seen that financial professionals can easily and organically insert these research-based words into client conversations.
For example:
“Mary, I’m glad you called today, and I want you to know that we’ve been monitoring your portfolio throughout these changing circumstances. We may recommend adjusting some of your holdings. We’ll certainly keep you informed of that. In the meantime, I’m here, as always, to help you navigate this difficulty.”
As Co-Head of Invesco Global Consulting Scott West says, “Effective communications can be tricky, and even the most talented financial professionals can stray from best practices. That is exactly why we focus on acronyms like M.A.I.N that are easy to remember, client-focused, and offer a clear and concise articulation of services and value provided.”
The research-based techniques we’ve outlined have proven effective in helping financial professionals communicate their service, value, and client support, even in challenging times. We firmly believe that communicating in this way with clients may lead to better results for both parties. However, that’s only part of the equation. Perhaps most importantly, when talking to clients — at the risk of sounding preachy — remember to listen. As in all areas of life, there’s often nothing we can say that’s more valuable or generates more trust than truly listening.

Key takeaways
The current environment is driving the speed of change
There's no lasting impact on the direction of structural change, but we see an acceleration of those changes.
Digital payments use has been increasing
Adoption of digital payments, which had been expected to play out over a matter of years, has played out over a matter of months.
Most individuals have changed the way they pay
78% of consumers have made changes to the way they pay — from shopping online to using contactless payments.

Over the past few months, clients have asked me how the current environment has transformed the direction of structural change in the global economy. My reply is always that I don’t see a lasting impact on the direction of structural change, but I do see the crisis accelerating many of the structural changes that I’ve already been long invested in – e-commerce, working from home, telemedicine, and digital payments, to name a few. Let me dig into digital payments to illustrate what I mean.
Long before the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global payments landscape was experiencing fundamental transformation. Over the past few years, customer expectations and behaviors have been changing, the impact of technology has been tremendous, global demographics have evolved, and the market has been reshaped by both traditional and new types of payment providers. These changes and the overall digitization of payments had been unfolding gradually. When the pandemic hit, these trends accelerated at a pace few could have predicted. In fact, the adoption of such digital payments, which had been expected to play out over three to five years, occurred in three to five months.
A surge toward “digital-first”
The pandemic caused the world to move from physical to digital overnight, and across almost every industry: entertainment (streaming), health care (telemedicine), restaurants (online ordering and takeout), retail (e-commerce), and education (remote learning). And this surge toward a “digital-first” world served as an incredible tailwind for electronic payments and the companies that excel in that space, like PayPal. The fund I manage has owned PayPal for a number of years, and I continue to be impressed with how its managers run their business and how the company continues to evolve as a leader in technology and digital payments. PayPal recently recorded its best quarter ever with remarkable Q2 results.
Let me give you a few of their figures to demonstrate how drastic this transformation has been. PayPal registered 21 million net new active accounts (up 137% year-over-year [YoY]), recorded total payment volume of $222 billion (up 30% YoY) and had 346 million average daily users (up 21% YoY). They also posted record revenues of $5.26 billion (up 25% YoY) and added 1.7 million new merchants during the period. In addition, the PayPal-owned app Venmo saw tremendous growth and now has over 60 million users.1 Whereas the app’s main utility used to be for transactions like splitting a restaurant bill, the current environment has revealed a whole host of new use cases, such as sending donations or paying your barber.
The pandemic also accelerated online payments engagement from new cohorts and industries, notably seniors, small local businesses, and online fitness services. Seniors, who were perhaps reluctant in years past to engage in digital payments, were essentially left with no other option but to shift to e-commerce for their goods and services while they sheltered in place. Similarly, local businesses that historically did not offer digital payment options, had to quickly get on board to enable their customers to order and pay online. Lastly, with the closure of gyms and other fitness centers, trainers and gym owners created accounts for clients to engage in virtual sessions.
Not only has there been a shift to online payments, but there has also been a move to contactless payments in-store. To protect the health of their employees and customers as retail shops open, contactless payment is now a necessity for stores. While changing behavior at the point of sale had been a gradual shift over time, the change has now been immediate. More and more consumers say they no longer want to handle cash. They also don’t want to handle a shop’s pen to sign a receipt or use a touchscreen. Companies have been responding quickly and offering things like tap-and-go, which allows you to simply tap your card against the machine you would have inserted your card into, without needing to enter a PIN. In the US, 84 of the top 100 merchants accept contactless payments and small businesses have also been making the shift to provide a safe and efficient experience for their customers.2
Majority of consumers have changed the way they pay
According to a recent Visa study, 78% of consumers have made changes to the way they pay, whether that be from shopping online, not using cash, or using contactless payments.3 Visa is another company the fund owns that has a massive network and is well-positioned, in our view, to benefit from the payments evolution. In the first half of 2020, Visa issuers distributed 80 million contactless cards, as tap-and-go transactions are embraced as a much easier way to pay and have proved to increase card usage. It’s worth noting that Visa’s recent numbers also reflect the boom in e-commerce due to the lockdown. Its card-not-present volume rose almost 40% from the same period a year earlier.4 (Card-not-present transactions occur when a card isn’t physically presented, such as with online or phone orders.)
The dramatic transformation in the world of payments in 2020 has been exciting to watch, for both investors and consumers. I believe several of the trends we’ve witnessed this year will persist well into the future. As we look even farther out, the innovation within the payments industry has a long way to run – from even faster payments to the incorporation of payments through virtual reality to blockchain technologies and the Internet of Things. An example of the latter would be your refrigerator detecting that you are low on milk and automatically ordering and paying for a replacement from your online grocery delivery service. We certainly have a lot to look forward to.

Key takeaways
The market for convertibles has been strong
New US convertible issuance currently stands at about $81 billion, higher than all of 2019.
""Rescue"" companies dominated new issuances in early days of the pandemic
Cash-strapped companies in hard-hit sectors sought capital to help weather the downturn.
What's next for convertibles?
We expect the issuance calendar to remain healthy, though at a slightly more modest pace.

As a relatively small and often overlooked asset class, convertible securities rarely make headlines. However, the asset class has received a great deal of attention from financial publications in recent months. Convertibles have been making the news for two primary reasons — record-setting new issuance, and strong absolute and relative performance.

COVID-19 spurred a wave of convertible issuance early this year
A convertible security is a corporate bond that has the ability to be converted into a fixed number of shares of the issuer’s common stock. New US convertible issuance has been strong this year, currently standing at about $81 billion according to Bank of America. That’s higher than all of 2019, which was in itself a very strong year with about $53 billion.1 This is the highest level of issuance since before the financial crisis, when issuance totaled $95 million in 2007. 1 Additionally, with this surge in new issuance, the US convertibles market is now expanding versus shrinking, having recently crossed over the $300 billion threshold for total market value compared to around $200 billion just two years ago.1
In the early days of the pandemic, new issuance was largely generated from “rescue names” — cash-strapped companies in sectors like retail, travel, and restaurants that were looking for capital to help weather the downturn. That was different than the issuance that we saw over the past few years, which tended to be from companies (primarily within tech and health care) that were seeking growth capital. Some of the rescue names that have recently issued convertibles are household names like Carnival Cruise Lines, Southwest Airlines, Callaway Golf, and American Eagle Outfitters.2 All saw huge revenue declines when COVID-19 hit, and the new issues were offered at very attractive terms, in my view.

Key takeaways
Trends have emerged amid the crisis
Some noticeable trends have emerged, but we uncover less obvious changes in consumer behavior.
Pandemic fears hit spending
As fears over the coronavirus peaked in April, fell 16% year-over-year.
Services spending remains low
Despite a temporary boost in durables expenditure over the summer, services spending continues to suffer.

Since the start of 2020, we have witnessed the most volatile period of consumer spending in US history. The primary catalyst has been the COVID-19 pandemic, which has taken almost 1 million lives globally.1 It has been the worst pandemic since the Asian flu in 1957, which resulted in 1.1 million lives lost, including 100,000 in the US.2 To minimize the chance of contracting the virus, millions of consumers have disrupted their lives to avoid contact with others. Businesses and local governments have also restricted commerce to enforce social distancing guidelines. These changes have caused consumer spending to plunge, driven by sharp declines in spending on services and consumer durables. While some obvious consumer trends have emerged from the COVID-19 crisis — such as the boon to online retailers and the devastating damage to the cruise industry — we analyze recent consumer data to uncover less obvious COVID-19-related trends and changes in consumer behavior.

Shifts in US consumer spending patterns
US consumer spending totaled some $13 trillion in 2019.3 Most spending was on services ($8.5 trillion) followed by non-durable goods, like groceries ($3 trillion), and durable goods, like appliances ($1.8 trillion).3 After the onset of the pandemic in March, US spending on non-durables spiked by around 7% year-over-year, as consumers stocked pantries to prepare for an extended home stay (Figure 1). Spending on durable goods and services, on the other hand, fell by around 8% (Figure 1). As fears over the coronavirus peaked in April, total spending fell an astounding 16% year-over-year, but consumption in certain services sectors, such as hotels and airlines, cratered by more than 80% versus the previous year.4

Key takeaways
Muni returns rebound
Municipal bonds reversed first-quarter declines while yield differentials emerged.
Stimulus and supply-and-demand drive momentum
Monetary and fiscal stimuli coupled with favorable supply-and-demand conditions to aid the recovery.
Future tax hikes could further boost muni performance
A thirst for yield and an appetite for tax-exempt income could drive investor interest in the municipal market.

Municipal bond prices rose during the second quarter, with investment grade and high yield municipal bond markets returning 2.73% and 4.55%, respectively.1 The quarter began with a continued decline in bond prices, picking up where March left off — with liquidity pressures leading to the heavy selling of municipal bonds, regardless of credit quality or duration. Performance improved heading into May and remained positive through June, as investors moved back into municipal bonds driven by a thirst for yield and an appetite for tax-exempt income.
The recovery was first seen in the investment grade municipal bond market. After reaching high levels in late March, investment grade municipal yields fell back to levels last seen in January 2020. High yield municipal yields trended down slightly but remained elevated. As a result, the spread, or difference between the two yields, increased, signaling there might be attractive opportunities in high yield municipal bonds for discerning investors (see Figure 1).

Even the savviest and most seasoned investor has never seen market behavior like that of the past six weeks. The dramatic down and up moves across virtually all asset classes leave us wondering if any investment has a future. We believe the sun will eventually shine again and suggest during periods of economic turbulence and credit stress that investors may wish to consider companies demonstrating financial strength. These quality businesses generally feature low leverage and strong cash flow and may provide the opportunity for desirable long-term returns.  
What is a “quality” company?
For those of us at Invesco involved in ETF strategy, a quality company is one with strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet. By this definition, quality is more concerned with a company’s financial position rather than earnings growth or valuation. One of the explanations for how the quality factor potentially rewards investors is this focus on financial health. Of course, these metrics (return on equity, cash flow generation and leverage) take time to analyze but can also provide general economic and industry insight, which can be of great value to investors. 
The quality continuum
In order to better understand the characteristics of quality, it may be instructive to compare a generally accepted “quality” index to one that is of lesser quality. We will use the S&P 500 High Quality Index and S&P 500 High Beta Index (the lower quality proxy) as examples. High beta stocks tend to be more cyclical, use higher leverage, have weaker balance sheets, and generate lower profitability. The table below highlights that the S&P 500 Quality Index has less debt, a higher return on equity, stronger cash flow and more robust profit margins than the S&P 500 High Beta and the S&P 500.

Construct a practice capable of attaining and retaining high-net-worth clientele.
Every business, regardless of industry, is composed of two components: structure and people. If the business lacks a coherent structure and repeatable systems, that deficiency can stifle the productivity of even the most talented and engaged personnel. If, on the other hand, the business is well-structured but the people are misaligned and/or poorly trained, results could also suffer.

Is reduced liquidity the problem?
The roller coaster equity ride has been inescapable in recent weeks, with dramatic moves in both directions now a common occurrence. But what about fixed income, normally considered a safe haven from the equity storm? With the exception of treasuries, bonds have had a surprisingly rough time of late. Is investor behavior predicting a wave of COVID-19 related defaults, or are other factors at work? We believe the latter – current fixed income troubles are due to the evaporation of liquidity. 
Central banks on the case
While the economic impact of the pandemic has been unprecedented, so has the response of central banks. In the US, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has implemented over $1 trillion in new quantitative easing while establishing direct purchase programs for almost every class of investment grade security. This could potentially expand the Fed’s balance sheet by nearly $4 trillion. In addition, we estimate that the US fiscal stimulus already totals around 10% of gross domestic product and could expand to 15%1. Globally, policymakers have cut rates over 60 times so far in 2020, pledged about $12 trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus, and will be purchasing $7 trillion in assets2. Clearly, central banks are concerned about liquidity. 
Their concerns seem to be well-founded. In just the last week of February, high yield spreads blew out 140 basis points3. Even investment grade has also experienced some pain, particularly reflected within the corresponding corporate and municipal ETFs. And of course, certain sectors like energy, retail, restaurants, and autos are being dumped indiscriminately. The chart of widening investment grade bid-asked spreads below clearly shows the effect of reduced liquidity.

Using history to offer perspective on volatile markets
It’s been a difficult year for markets. But it’s always important to remind clients we have been here before. While the impact of the pandemic may seem unique, markets have historically ridden through periods of extreme turbulence.
While no one can offer any guarantees for the future, we are here to help you provide historical examples to demonstrate to your clients the importance of not overreacting to down markets or giving in to herd mentality. For investors with long-term horizons, the markets have proven to be resilient, overcoming short-term bouts of volatility to have delivered, historically at least, the results investors often needed to achieve their financial goals. History even suggests there may be potential benefits of using market downturns as a buying opportunity.

4 Steps Designed to Elevate Client Engagements
Every business/practice in the United States has two fundamental components: structure and people. The business structure comprises systems, processes and technology; the more thoughtful and elegant, the easier the business is to manage and grow. The people must be aligned within that structure to leverage their unique talents and skills for the greatest impact on the enterprise and the clientele. We use the metaphor of a house to illustrate the basic structure of your practice. In our view, that house, your practice, has four rooms: the New Business Development Room, the Wealth Management Room, the Client Service Room and the Practice Management Room. At any point during the day, you and/or your team members are in one of those four rooms doing something.
Your clients, however, will likely judge you and your practice based on how you perform in the Wealth Management and Client Service Rooms, which when combined, make up your client engagement strategy. Your ability to attract and retain high-net-worth clients is often dependent on your ability to implement a comprehensive wealth management strategy and to provide an exceptional and highly personalized level of service and recognition.
We developed a program with four actionable steps designed to help you in this endeavor.
Step 1 Benchmarking the Four Rooms of Your Practice
In this first step, you will analyze the four fundamental components (rooms) that compose every practice: new business development, wealth analysis and management, client service and practice management. To get an accurate appraisal of where your practice currently stands, we believe it is critical that all team members complete this form in order to incorporate their unique positions and perspectives on the team. You will then be in a position to conduct a team meeting in which you work to reconcile any disparities between individual team members and arrive at a final benchmark that accurately reflects your current business model.
Step 2 Enhancing Your Structural Capability to Execute for Your Clientele
A. Personal Client Intake Form
This form acts as a complement to and provides context for your traditional wealth management/financial planning discovery tool provided by your firm. The latter provides all the financial data ON your client, while the former provides all the personal insights FROM your client, both of which we believe are necessary to provide the best advice TO your client.
B. Wealth Management Implementation Checklist
Many financial professionals claim that they provide comprehensive wealth management, but we have found that oftentimes financial professionals don’t fully deliver on that claim. The vertical version of this tool is built to allow you to look at the services provided to each client individually. The horizontal version is built to allow you to look at your entire clientele. The former becomes an individual roadmap for each client meant to help get them to their individual goals, while the latter is designed to help you uncover overall gaps that you can batch process as a team.
C. Client Segmentation Tool
When you think about the characteristics that would define your “ideal client,” there are both quantitative (assets, revenue, etc.) and qualitative (COI, time consumption, etc.) components that we believe must be captured in order to get an accurate picture of the overall impact of that relationship on you, your team and your practice.
D. Stratified Client Service Matrix
Once you’ve segmented your clientele both qualitatively and quantitatively, it’s time to stratify your service levels in an effort to reflect that segmentation. Do treat your clients “fair but not equal.” We suggest devoting the most time, energy and resources to those that not only sustain your business today but will also help you grow for years to come.
E. Comprehensive Client Review Template
In our view, managing your client’s assets begins by helping your clients manage their emotions. It’s your client’s perceptions and misperceptions, fears and phobias, exacerbated by a 24-hour news cycle and the crisis of the moment that often stands between you and your clients’ long-term financial success. The focus of our comprehensive client review is twofold: to ensure you complete the client’s wealth management journey and provide the context necessary to keep them “buckled-in” to your overarching investment structure and strategy.
Step 3 Optimizing the Talents of Your Team
A. Expanding Your Human Capacity
We have found that the most productive people spend 60–70% of their weeks doing the 3–5 things that only they “can and should” do for the greatest impact on the business. By the way, just because you can do something better than anyone on your team, doesn’t mean that you should be the one doing it. This tool is designed to help you work collaboratively with each individual member of your team to determine what those 3–5 highest impact activities are, remove obstacles standing in their way and create an action plan to incrementally move towards that 60–70% allocation of time.
B. Aligning Roles and Responsibilities in the “Four Rooms”
After completing the previous steps, you are likely equipped to begin to align your roles and responsibilities between your various internal and external team members for the greatest impact on your practice. We have provided the most common roles, delineated in each of the “four rooms” of your practice that we believe are necessary to serve your high-net-worth clientele.
Step 4 Implementation and Impact Report
This tool combines the critical activities within each room we believe are necessary to fully implement the previous three steps and the actual impact that implementation has on your bottom-line results.

Expertise across diverse markets can help investors seeking to realize income and manage volatility
In the past, investors often relied on US Treasuries to pursue current income and add stability to their portfolios. But as outlined in Income Investing with Invesco, today’s markets demand a broader and more diversified approach.

""Now, let me take a moment to explain how we accomplish this. We have incorporated the same three-step approach practiced by some family physicians.

In the diagnostic phase, he/she is likely going to focus on three areas: your past medical history, your current symptoms, and, if he's/she's really good, your long-term objectives for your overall health. He/She is then going to take all that data, all that content, all those insights, and come back with the prognosis. Then, and likely only then, will he/she come back with a specific, targeted treatment regimen designed to take you on your unique medical journey.
""We utilize the same three-step architectural framework in our practice. Step one is deep discovery. In the discovery phase, we focus on three areas: your past financial history, your current financial structure, and your future financial objectives for your long-term well-being.

Have this conversation during your annual review or over lunch with clients you wish to replicate.  
""Mary, have I ever explained to you how we manage our practice? Great; let me take a moment and explain it because it impacts you as a client. At its essence, likely every business in the United States has two fundamental requirements if they're going to survive: to grow and to serve. Fail at either, and over time, the business will probably atrophy and die.
In our experience, one of the greatest challenges is allocating time and resources appropriately to those two critical requirements. We find that many financial professionals spend 70% of their time trying to grow and only about 30% of their time actively engaged in serving their existing clientele. We have reversed those percentages in our practice, which we believe is one of the benefits of our team structure. We spend 70% of our time working with our existing clientele and only about 30% trying to grow our practice.
Is it safe for me to assume that, as a client, you would like us to continue to work that way? Great! The only way we have been able to accomplish this is with the help of our best clients. Those clients consistently introduce our team to individuals and families that they believe might benefit from our services. Now, before you give me any names, let me describe the kind of people that we are best designed to serve. And frankly, Mary, this is the easy part. If we had 100 clients just like you, not only would we be one of the most productive practices in Dallas, we would also be one of the happiest because our friendship transcends a purely business relationship. So, Mary, I'd like you to think of two or three people that, when you look at them, you feel like you're looking into a mirror. Now, when I said that, who just popped into your mind?""
In our view, the key to this referral request is that it only works for those clients that you wish to clone. If this is not true, it will probably be blatantly disingenuous and therefore likely fail miserably. However, for the right client, whose relationship with you is more than just a business relationship, this may work for the following reasons:

It's likely genuinely flattering.
It likely engages one of the most powerful human instincts, enlightened self-interest. ""It is in my interest to keep you off the streets and in front of my portfolio.""
The request is specific (""When you look at them ..."") rather than general (""Whom do you know ...?""), which, of course, brings specific and pre-qualified people to mind.

We believe that outstanding teams have much in common with great marriages, as both are often philosophically aligned on the core tenets that inform their most important decisions.
Families may ask themselves: “How are we going to align spending and savings, balance our kids' responsibilities with the joy of childhood, and determine our career and family roles and responsibilities?”
Team members may ask themselves: “How are we going to align compensation and performance, foster an open, collaborative environment with a high degree of accountability, and balance our need to both grow and serve our clientele?”

Explain the rationale, structure, and value of your team in helping clients ""pick the lock of complexity"" in their financial lives
""Mr. and Mrs. Jones, we have formed a team because of a single concept, and that concept is 'complexity.' I could make a great argument that life has never been this good; however, I could make an equally compelling argument that life has never been this complex. And, ironically, the wealthier you are, the more complex your financial challenges become. They get to a point where you need the fully integrated capability of three institutions: the banking industry, the brokerage industry, and the insurance industry, to handle your complex financial challenges.
“Historically, the only way to accomplish this has been to have a couple of banking relationships, two or three brokerage relationships, and a couple of insurance people, all living in their respective silos, attempting to give you the insights and solutions necessary to deal with your complex financial challenges. The problem with this approach is the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. You often get contradictory information and/or redundancies.
“Because one person is incapable of knowing all that's necessary to deliver these institutional capabilities, we've formed a team of highly specialized individuals with the goal of bringing to our clientele the capability, depth of knowledge, and insight necessary to address their complex financial challenges. We then wrap this capability in an overarching, comprehensive wealth management plan of attack, which we designed shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients to help ensure that everything that must happen does happen.""
In closing, basic investment guidance and portfolio management is under immense pressure from discounters, regulators, and robo-advisors.

The economics of retirement distributions

Why do successful “accumulators” outlive their money? Because the investment rules change in retirement. Dr. Moshe Milevsky, Executive Director of The Individual Finance and Insurance Decision (IFID) Centre, studied the critical factors that lead to success or failure in retirement and distilled them down to three factors. Invesco Global Consulting then partnered with Dr. Milevsky, simplified the research, and created simple, persuasive communication tools designed for financial professionals to use with investors.

Key takeaways
Some economic wounds may be avoidable
Stalling economic data may be exacerbated by families losing unemployment benefits.
Schools can accelerate COVID infections
With an incredibly high rate of transmission, if schools open for in-person classes, it could hasten a second wave of infections.
Economic de-coupling may occur
Short-term decoupling of economies that aren’t able to control the virus from most other major economies is possible.

Weekly Market Compass: A federal unemployment benefit ends, Congress continues to debate about stimulus, and many fear schools could hasten a ‘second wave’ of virus cases
Last Friday, my oldest child graduated from high school. Late July is not normally associated with graduations, but we are living in a time of COVID, and so what was supposed to occur two months earlier in the New York area was postponed and rescheduled. We were incredibly grateful to our son’s high school for putting on five separate graduation ceremonies in the course of a day to comply with New York State regulations that allow a maximum of 150 people to attend gatherings. Given the need to fit in five ceremonies in one day, the event felt like one part important milestone and one part fast food drive thru — which made it the first high school graduation I ever attended that was efficiently run and ended before you actually started wishing it could end. I was struck by the commencement speaker and his very honest words to the graduates. He told them that he couldn’t imagine having to miss out on the many important senior-year milestones that the class of 2020 missed because of the pandemic. He told them that this year has created a wound that will take years to heal.
Hearing those words, my mind couldn’t help but wander a bit, thinking about all the economic wounds created by the pandemic. The second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) reports for a number of major economies came to mind. I thought of the many wonderful small businesses that have closed permanently, and the large companies that survived other economic crises over the years only to have filed for bankruptcy during this pandemic. And I thought about my youngest child’s school, which was one of a number of schools permanently closed by our diocese because of the very difficult economic climate.
Some economic wounds may be avoidable
I also thought about the potential for self-inflicted wounds that could exacerbate an already-difficult situation. For example, last Friday marked the day many Americans would begin losing federal unemployment benefits. We are already starting to see a stalling of economic data, and families losing their benefits could make August’s data even worse.
I know I have shared this statistic before, but I will share it again: 37% of American households do not have enough savings to meet a $400 emergency expense — and that statistic comes from a Federal Reserve survey conducted before the pandemic hit the US.1 In addition, other households — with mostly white collar employees who are able to work from home — are not spending much and instead continue to hold elevated levels of cash, as seen in a relatively high personal savings rate of 19% for the month of June.2 This isn’t a good sign for businesses that rely on consumer spending — and I believe that the savings rate is likely to move higher if the virus is not controlled. 
The US Senate still seems far from reaching a deal — at least one that addresses all the pressing needs facing America, including state and local government funding. I suspect August will be something of a “Great Stall” for the US economy if high unemployment and rising virus cases persist without adequate fiscal stimulus. As Fed Chair Jay Powell stressed last week: “The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus.”3 Powell also felt it important to add that, in this environment, more fiscal stimulus is critically needed (and, of course, the Fed will remain extremely accommodative).
Could schools set off a ‘second wave’ of virus cases?
Of course, that raises an important question: Will the virus persist? It certainly appears that the virus may have peaked in a number of “hot spot” states and could be in the process of being tamed. However, we are now entering back-to-school season, which carries with it the potential for many “super-spreading” occasions. I am more concerned about this possibility after reading a report released on Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the CDC) about a COVID-19 outbreak at a sleepaway camp in northern Georgia in late June. Campers and staff had to meet safety protocol — including a negative COVID-19 test — before being able to stay at the camp. Staff members were required to wear masks, but campers were not. They participated in normal camp activities until a camp counselor became ill just a few days after camp began, and later tested positive for COVID-19. More than half of those at the camp were tested for COVID-19, and a stunning 76% tested positive.4
I, like many of you, am the parent of several school-age children, and I was happily preparing them to go back to school in September, but this report gave me pause. While the Georgia camp did not require campers to wear face masks (perhaps the simplest action to help prevent the spread of the virus without impacting the economy), most states will likely require students to wear face masks.  Even so, that was an incredibly high rate of transmission, and so if schools do open for in-person classes, I fear it could hasten a second wave of infections. And this in turn could lead many Americans to return to “self-quarantine” — sheltering in place whether or not government officials direct them to.
Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, has also warned about how widespread the virus has become; in many ways, it is now more dangerous than it was in March and April when it was concentrated in a few big cities in the US because it is now in both rural and urban areas around the country.5  She also warned about “super-spreading events,” which I fear could include sending students back to school — at least in areas where the virus has not been sufficiently tamped down. This could prove to be another self-inflicted wound to the US economy — but hopefully I will be wrong.
The US is not alone in its potential to inflict wounds upon itself. Re-opening economies too quickly or becoming less disciplined about following safety protocol threatens to cause unnecessary wounds to any economy. Some countries such as Spain are facing virus resurgences that could prove economically damaging if they are not able to control them in the near term. Even British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is worried about this and has warned the UK not to create a self-inflicted wound through lack of vigilance: “… I have to tell you that we are looking at a resurgence of the virus in some other European countries and you can see what’s been happening in the United States, and so it is absolutely vital as a country that we continue to keep our focus and our discipline.”6
What does this mean for the US economy?
Given all of these concerns, I anticipate a short-term decoupling of the US economy (and other economies that aren’t able to control the virus) from most other major economies that are likely to see continued improvement. Recent economic data has borne this out. Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for China7 showed slow but continued improvement in June, while industrial production in South Korea showed significant growth after disappointment in May.8 And I expect Eurozone PMI this coming week to show improvement. Not only is large fiscal stimulus coming to the eurozone, but there is already a significant social safety net there — unlike the US. Last week, the US saw a second week of rising initial jobless claims after 15 weeks of declining initial jobless claims.9 And I expect that the July jobs report for the US will be disappointing as well.
This all suggests that in the near term, US dollar weakness is likely to persist while US Treasuries and gold are likely to remain popular. I think US stocks might underperform other regions modestly. However, earnings season has been positive thus far, which should be mildly positive for US stocks. And, more importantly, US stocks have the Fed supporting them and other risk assets.
If economic data does weaken and the virus is not well-controlled in the US, I expect secular growth stocks, especially in the technology sector, to outperform.  However, I expect a dramatic shift in leadership to cyclical stocks and away from “safe haven” asset classes such as Treasuries and gold once economic data begins to improve significantly again or an effective vaccine is introduced. And that may not be far off.
It’s clear that significant progress is being made toward a vaccine based on clinical trials being conducted by a number of pharma/biotech companies: Five companies are already in Phase 3 clinical trials or will be starting by the end of September, according to Dr. Moncef Slaoui, an immunologist and chief advisor to the US’ Operation Warp Speed — the project to create a COVID-19 virus. He expects to have millions of doses of effective vaccine by December 2020 or January 2021.10  Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, who has devoted his long career to the treatment of infectious diseases, recently said he is “cautiously optimistic” a vaccine could be available by January.11 Until then, we will be following a wide range of data closely, given that the economic outlook is impacted by medical and scientific progress, fiscal stimulus and consumer and corporate behavior.

Moving from transactional to transformative leadership
Leadership is all about movement: taking individuals, teams, or organizations (even your family members) on their journeys — from where they are to where they must go, and from who they are to who they must become.
Management and leadership are often distinct but potentially complementary; you manage structure and systems, but you lead people. Occasionally, you find both of these capabilities in a single individual — but rarely. From our view, the vast majority of great leaders are, more often than not, supported by one or more outstanding managers (people who can keep the trains running on time). For every Walt Disney, there was a Roy Disney; General George Patton’s strategic vision arguably needed the more empathetic and detail-oriented General Omar Bradley for implementation; and Ronald Reagan likely needed James Baker for the same reasons.
We believe expanding your ability to influence and persuade those around you requires an understanding of, and adherence to, the following five areas:

The comfort zone: Your most insidious and persistent adversary
Foundational principles: The universal truths that often govern success, failure, and fulfillment
The root cause of underperformance: An eight-point, sequential, diagnostic checklist
Pattern recognition: That people don’t have problems; they have patterns
Motivational structure: The move from external to internal motivation

Justin Leverenz, CFA
Team Leader and Senior Portfolio Manager
Key takeaways
A weak dollar may benefit emerging markets
The big structural moves in emerging markets occur against a weak US dollar.
Capital is flowing away from the US
Low interest rates and energy prices are helping to push investment and capital to non-US assets.
China is supplying global growth
China is the only significant source of growth in a dismal worldwide growth story.

We believe that the decade ahead will be particularly good for emerging markets (EM) equities. While this may come across as contrarian, it essentially rests on a handful of considerations: 
Weakness in the dollar. The big structural moves in (non-China) EM equities are nearly always against the backdrop of weakness in the US dollar. And we see all the ingredients for significant US dollar weakness over the next few years, largely a reflection of considerable fiscal stress in the United States. We believe the federal debt stock will continue to expand at what can only be considered a highly unorthodox pace. The US federal debt is estimated to have surged from nearly $17 trillion in September 2019 to $20 trillion in June 2020.1 And the flow is even more dramatic. The US federal deficit crested $1 trillion in 2019 at peak cyclical employment levels.1 We expect the federal deficit to significantly worsen over the next two to three years, even after the pandemic subsides, as the highly contested November presidential elections lead the winning administration to address longstanding grievances associated with socioeconomic inequalities.

""What got you here won't get you there.""
Outstanding long-term companies survive long-term by constantly adapting to evolving markets, technological innovations, and new competitive entries. You can do the same by continually challenging your assumptions and value proposition in three critical areas:
1. Product/process leadership

Stay abreast of new products, processes, and technologies in your marketplace to help you enhance and diversify your revenue streams.
Hire a diverse talent pool that allows you to constantly expand your product and service offerings.
Embrace and reward innovation and education.

2. Operational efficiency

Create an assembly line ""behind the curtain"" and a concierge service in front of it.
Define roles and responsibilities and disciplined teamwork.
Control your calendar to allow adequate prep time.

3. Client intimacy

Know your clients personally and professionally, and respond accordingly.
Help each client navigate his/her unique and complex financial journey through your comprehensive and integrated approach.
Don't just fulfill your clients’ needs; instead, get to a point where you can anticipate them.

Overview
The focus of these meetings is to enhance and refine your existing practice in the three areas above.

Use the toolkits: Utilize our Diagnostic Toolkit, designed to be a systematic blueprint and meant to not only help you begin this journey, but to actually complete it. Incorporate the other toolkits as you get to those topics and systems.
Foster collaboration: This is a highly collaborative exercise because we believe you need the collective insights of all team members, based on their unique perspectives from their respective positions on the team.
Create accountability: Work to ensure that each team member is clear on their respective responsibilities and timeframes by the conclusion of each meeting.
Be solutions-focused: No team member is permitted to state a problem without also having thought through a couple of potential solutions. This diffuses the risk of team meetings becoming nothing more than gripe sessions.
Practice time management: Start and end on time, keeping in mind that this meeting is nothing more than another system in your practice.
Maintain a controlled environment: Hold these meetings in a small conference room, preferably late Thursday afternoon. This may help you avoid distraction and ""gets the week behind you,"" potentially allowing you to focus on the long-term structural evolution of your practice.

57,/content/invesco/us/en/insights/taking-the-fear-out-of-fees,Taking the fear out of fees,"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 17:44:54 +0000",,Client Service,,Your practice,Insight,"['Financial Professional', 'EDJONES', 'PFS']",NOT_ACTIVATED,https://www.invesco.com/us/en/insights/taking-the-fear-out-of-fees.html,200,"Taking the fear out of fees



Historically, financial professionals have often been a little wary of discussing their fee structures with their clientele. With increasing transparency, regulatory pressures, and the rise of robo-advisors, this fear seems to have increased.
Regardless of the catalyst, there are only two real reasons why financial professionals might be reticent to discuss fees:

They haven't formulated a simple and elegant way to articulate the rationale for their fee structures. Fortunately, this is a relatively easy fix.
They have a nagging suspicion that their practices aren't worthy of their asking prices. This is a much more difficult fix but not impossible to overcome.

So, let's tackle the more challenging issue first. If a financial professional feels that his/her practice may in fact not be worthy of referrals, how can he/she determine whether that assessment is accurate or not? We have created a diagnostic toolkit built to allow you to benchmark your practice against a best-in-class model. We use the metaphor of a house to illustrate the structure of your practice. That house — your practice — is, in our view, made up of four rooms: the New Business Development Room, the Wealth Management Room, the Client Service Room, and the Practice Management Room. We give you five questions to answer per room that are designed to give you an accurate barometer as to how well each component of your practice is performing.
Optimizing your practice
The two rooms upon which you will likely be judged most harshly by your clientele are the Wealth Management and Client Service Rooms.

The Wealth Management Room is where you analyze the complex challenges facing your wealthiest clients, architect a comprehensive set of solutions, and most importantly, implement all of the discrete components that are likely necessary to actually fulfill the plan. It is this final step that we have found is often missing. Too many financial professionals, once the assets come in and the portfolio is structured, fail to follow through on the remainder of the plan and therefore leave the client, his/her family, and often his/her business exposed to significant risk. You must understand that portfolio management, as a singular value proposition, is becoming increasingly commoditized and digitalized, and is therefore being priced accordingly. We believe it is only a comprehensive, fully integrated and implemented wealth management approach that is capable of maintaining healthy and justifiable margins.
In our view, the Client Service Room must rapidly evolve from a generic and often reactive engagement model to one that is highly personalized, systematized, and proactive. We have put together a comprehensive tool titled ""Crafting a High Performance Practice"" toolkit, built to help you systematically analyze, hone, and refine both your wealth management implementation structure and your client service platform.

Communicating your fee structure
Once these two ""rooms"" are optimized, you are likely positioned to have the following conversation with new and/or existing clients to explain your overarching fee structure.
""There are two ways our industry charges for its guidance, products, and services: commissions on transactions and products, or fees based on assets under management. We utilize the fee structure for the following reasons:

Charging a small fee each year rather than a large commission at the beginning of a relationship means that we are rewarded based on the longevity of our relationships. As a result, our comprehensive wealth management approach, our highly personalized and long-term investment strategy, and our concierge-level client service model have all been designed to help you and your family achieve all of your long-term dreams, goals, and aspirations.
Charging a fee also puts us on the ‘same side of the table as our clients'; as your assets and income grow, so do ours, and if we have a downturn in the markets, it impacts us as well. At the end of the day, our success reflects yours.
And finally, it allows us to remain completely agnostic with both our guidance and our selection of products and services necessary to fulfill your comprehensive financial plan. Whether our guidance is to buy, sell, or hold, and whether our product mix is individual securities or utilizing professional portfolio managers, our fees remain constant. There is never an economic incentive to move our clients in and out of particular investments or products to generate revenue.""

In closing, basic investment guidance and portfolio management is under immense pressure from discounters, regulators, and robo-advisors. If that's all you provide, your clients are likely questioning why they are paying fees for a service they can either outsource at a lower cost or obtain from another financial professional who also addresses their needs above and beyond what has now become the expected norm. However, if you help relatively wealthy clients solve their complex financial challenges by providing nuanced financial insights, philosophical and historical context meant to keep them ""buckled in"" to your investment strategies, and a comprehensive set of solutions built to help bring order to their financial lives, your clients might be more likely to stay, and even better, they'll perhaps be inclined to using your praises to their friends, family, and colleagues.

Your value proposition
Here is a suggested script to eloquently and concisely describe what you do for your clients.
""Our team was built to answer the two most fundamental questions that anyone has of our industry: 'Will I make it?'  and 'Do I have any financial blind spots?' When you strip away the white noise, these are the two most critical and profound questions that anyone has in his/her financial life.
""Question #1 asks: 'Will I make it?' In our experience, the vast majority of people we've met haven't even defined 'it,' so most people don't have a clue whether they're going to actually make it to all of their financial dreams, goals, and aspirations. The first thing our team does is go through a deep discovery process where we help you define everything you're trying to accomplish in your financial life with a high degree of specificity. We then take everything you're currently doing financially, lay that on top of your goals, and tell you definitively whether you are, in fact, likely going to make it. If the answer is 'yes,' we pat you on the back and say, 'Congratulations, you're well on your way.' If the answer is 'no,' we surface the shortfalls and challenges and offer you rational solutions built to get you back on track.
""Once we've answered question #1, we move to question #2: 'Do I have any financial blind spots?' or 'Is there anything I've overlooked that could do my business, my family, or me any harm?' After all, there's likely nothing sadder in life than marching off toward all of your dreams, goals, and aspirations only to get blindsided by something you didn't anticipate. So, our team does a 360° look at you from a financial perspective, looking for any risk exposure you haven't uncovered. Once again, if we find something, we're going to surface the issue and offer you rational solutions meant to close that risk exposure.
""At the end of this exhaustive journey, you will hopefully have answered the two most fundamental and profound questions you've had: 'Will I make it?' and 'Do I have any financial blind spots?'""

No team nor its members is likely capable of turning failure into success — either individually or collectively. However, by putting in the proper structure, systems, roles, and responsibilities, there is potential to turn ""good to great,"" to coin a phrase. This step is built to allow prospective teams and team members to ""look under the hood"" of their prospective partners' businesses with the goal of ensuring that the practices meet their standards of structure and performance.

We believe there are two great risks to any compensation model:

Underpay excellence: We reside in an industry that actually doesn't manufacture anything, so likely all you have is your intellectual capital and your client engagement model to separate you from the competition. We believe there is no substitute for intellect. Always be willing to pay a little more for excellence because, in an increasingly commoditized world, mediocrity can be death!
Overpay mediocrity: Perhaps nothing destroys the morale of a team faster than someone not pulling his/her weight (especially if that someone is overpaid). Encourage team members to make sure they have the talent and the training necessary to do their jobs at an exceptional level first. If they don't, it's time to have a serious conversation, establish performance metrics, and, where possible, tie their bonuses to their performance.

Our ""yours, mine, and ours"" dating model is designed to last between 12 and 24 months. This model is built to allow you to ""test the water"" and to ensure that the synergies you anticipate in forming your team actually materialize. When they do, it is imperative, in our view, that you move to a permanent compensation structure that unifies the team around the entire clientele. You will see this model below.
""Dating"" compensation structure
When you are in the ""dating phase"" of a new relationship, you often have separate apartments, different circles of friends, separate checking accounts, and separate balance sheets. It is only after marriage, in most cases, that you bring these respective worlds together. We utilize the same sequencing model as you move from the exploratory phase, through the dating phase, and ultimately into a synergistic marriage of your respective practices. This model is built to allow you and your prospective partner(s) to test drive your new team structure without disrupting your respective practices. You open a joint account, seed that joint account with all-new business (and at your discretion, with some existing business), and work with those clients as you anticipate working with all of your respective clients once you become a fully integrated team. If you are the portfolio manager and your prospective partner is the financial planner, you bring that model to bear with your new joint clients. If you are adding a banking, lending, and/or estate planning specialist to your existing team, you might integrate that partner into your joint account clients to see how that works out before bringing the entire business together.

We have found that the single greatest challenge in leading and managing people is to ensure that they're all focusing on the three to five things that will have the greatest impact on their practices, their clientele, and their teams. The larger and more complex your practice is, the more challenging this likely becomes. We have seen that size often breeds complexity and that complexity diffuses focus. The ultimate goal for any team, in our view, is to have members spending 60% to 70% of their week on the three to five things that only they can and should do.
Step 1: Have each member of your team list what they believe to be their three to five critical objectives.
Step 2: Have them list any obstacles standing in their way and possible solutions.
Step 3: Meet with them to review their three to five objectives and make modifications where appropriate.
Step 4: Work together to finalize individual action plans.

Are investors interested in “minimizing losses” or “asset protection”? Do they want to be “educated” or “informed” about risks? Do they want to “plan forward” or “plan backward”?
Invesco Global Consulting teamed up with political consultant and word specialist, Maslansky + Partners, to find out. Maslansky + Partners, well known for shifting public opinion with phrases like “contract with America,” “death tax,” and “energy exploration,” applied its unique, scientific research to the language of risk.

We have seen that financial professionals (FPs) in teams outperform their sole practitioner peers, just like people in happy marriages have been found generally to live longer, happier, and healthier lives than their single counterparts. However, it's not the team or marriage alone that creates those statistics; it's the marriage/team comprising the right people that come together for the right reason at the right time in their lives. If you are missing even one of those three variables, the risks of severe problems and/or dissolution may rise.
Some common advice is that one should not fall in love with marriage; one should fall in love with a person who is a perfect fit for you. We believe the same thing holds true for adding a new team member: fall in love with a person who's a perfect fit for you, your practice, and your clientele.
Keep these considerations in mind when you consider forming a team:
1. At the right time
Forming a team or adding a new team member should be a last resort — never a first resort. Whenever you add a new person to your life (a spouse, a child, a friend, or a partner), it often creates another level of responsibility and complexity, and the benefits should far outweigh the cost. In our view, you should make sure you are where you need to be developmentally and structurally, that you've been in the business long enough to understand your own particular strengths and weaknesses, and that your practice is on solid footing so that the transition is as smooth and seamless as possible.
2. For the right reason
You likely always want to forge any personal and/or professional relationship from a position of strength. Forging a team with three individual fourth- and fifth-quintile producers probably will not miraculously turn them into first-quintile performers. Before you consider teaming up or adding team members, we believe you must enhance your practice structurally, systemically, and educationally. You can then look for someone whose talents, skills, and capabilities complement your own. This is how you create synergy in the classic formula of 1+1 = 3.
3. With the right person
For any relationship to have both synergy and sustainability, we believe it must be built on a common philosophical foundation with a complementary set of talents, skills, experiences, and passions. Let's take these two concepts one at a time:
Common philosophical foundation: Just as a home built on an unstable foundation goes unnoticed until the passage of time and severe storms reveal its weakness, we believe the same is true in relationships. They might look really great on the surface, but a nice façade can only mask structural challenges for so long. In our view, you must have thoughtful and frank discussions about issues like mission and vision, collaboration and delegation, wealth management and investment management, client service and compensation, and, ultimately, a commitment to work/life balance. In our experience, the majority of teams fail because they are not philosophically aligned around the core foundational tenets of the practice.
Complementary talents: The single most common mistake we see is team leaders ""hiring in their own likeness,"" or as we like to call it, ""the Mini-Me Syndrome."" With a nod to Austin Powers, this is when we hire someone who is exactly like us in every way — except 1/8 our size! Given the breadth and depth of responsibilities and capabilities necessary to deploy a comprehensive wealth management and/or institutional practice, a diverse talent pool is absolutely vital to your long-term success. We believe your team will need strategic thought and tactical application, business attraction and retention, high-touch and high-tech capabilities, and, where possible, demographic and cultural diversity of insight. In our view, when it comes to talents and skills, you don't need your counterpart; you need your counterpoint.

Key takeaways
Recent data shows wide-spread weakness in Europe
Europe is clearly at risk of a double-dip recession, albeit a modest one.
The UK gets more bad news
The UK appears to be at even greater risk than the eurozone of a double-dip recession in the current quarter.
US markets are focused on the potential for additional stimulus
Last week saw concern over adequate support for the passage of Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion package.

Weekly Market Compass: The next few months could be a slog for these economies
What a week — both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite Indexes reached all-time highs last Thursday, but we also saw a reversal of the rotation from growth/defensives to cyclicals in both European and US markets. Markets are clearly reacting to the problems that many economies are facing as COVID-19 continues to impact growth.
Recent data shows evidence of these problems.
Europe may face a modest recession
Europe is clearly at risk of a double-dip recession, albeit a modest one. The IHS Markit Flash Eurozone Composite PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) clocked in at 47.5, down from December’s 49.1.1 And it’s not just services that dragged down that number; there was also a decline in manufacturing PMI, which actually fell to a seven-month low. And the weakness was spread throughout Europe.
This should come as no surprise. The Oxford Blavatnik Stringency Index, which tracks the level of economic lockdowns in various countries, indicates that stringency in many European countries is at or near the highest levels that have been experienced since the start of the pandemic. In other words, first-quarter economic activity could contract again, although if it does, I would expect this to be a very shallow contraction. More fiscal support is coming, and I expect the European Central Bank to remain supportive.
And so Europe just needs to get through this “fifth quarter of 2020,” and then I expect the situation to improve. I think that by later in the second quarter, we will see improvement in economic activity as vaccine distribution becomes widespread.
The UK get more bad news
The UK is in a worse situation, at an even greater risk than the eurozone of a double-dip recession in the current quarter. The preliminary reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite PMI fell like a lead balloon, dropping from 50.4 in December to 40.6 in January.1 Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, explained the drop in the composite: ""Services have once again been especially hard hit, but manufacturing has seen growth almost stall, blamed on a cocktail of COVID-19 and Brexit, which has led to increasingly widespread supply delays, rising costs, and falling exports.""1
What’s more, on Friday UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson shared more bad news: 1) the UK strain of the virus is not only more contagious but appears to be more deadly; and 2) lockdowns might last until this summer. And so we should not expect economic strength in the near term, although I maintain that the economy is very likely to rebound substantially as vaccines are distributed.
Japan suffering too
Flash PMI readings for January indicate Japan is facing some headwinds too. Also last week the Bank of Japan warned of increasing risks to the economic outlook for Japan, and that efforts to control the virus could have impact beyond just the services sector. And while COVID-19 has been well-controlled in Japan relative to many Western countries, Japan has not yet rolled out any vaccines. They are still in clinical trials, but rollout is expected to start by late February.
The US awaits the fate of fiscal stimulus
The US is also facing serious economic headwinds due to COVID-19. US markets seem to have focused recently on the potential for additional fiscal stimulus. Janet Yellen, President Joe Biden’s nominee to be US Treasury Secretary, made a strong case for more fiscal stimulus last week. She recognized concerns about growing debt levels, but also argued that there’s no time like the present to borrow since rates are so low. However, by the end of the week there was concern that President Biden would not have enough support to get his proposed $1.9 trillion package passed.
On days when markets are encouraged by the likelihood of more stimulus and a stronger rebound, cyclical stocks have outperformed. But when markets are worried that no more stimulus is forthcoming, or when economic data disappoints, secular growth stocks — especially tech — have outperformed.
Key takeaways
I expect this “seesaw” stock market behavior to continue in the near term. While I still believe a strong economic rebound is in the offing later in 2021, there are likely to be glitches before we get there, as I have warned before. The tech sector has recently exhibited defensive qualities that I expect to continue and which I believe could be valuable in the next few months as we slog through what is likely to be a difficult time for the economy. Low interest rates help this situation given that tech valuations are admittedly stretched; investors have historically been more forgiving of valuations with rates so low.
The other side of the seesaw is exposure to cyclicals. I am most excited about one sector in particular: consumer discretionary. I think the global economic recovery will be robust and inclusive, creating and restoring jobs — and spurring consumers to spend. And in many countries, consumers have built up impressive savings because of a lack of spending during the pandemic. This could be deployed rather quickly once vaccines are distributed broadly and there is a return to something akin to “normalcy.”
I expect that, in a world awash in monetary stimulus, with significant fiscal stimulus as well, there will continue to be an upward bias for stocks. That doesn’t mean we won’t see a stock sell-off in 2021. It could be triggered by the 10-year US Treasury yield rising (we could see a sell-off if it rises too quickly) or fears about inflation increasing — even though I expect the Federal Reserve to reiterate this week its commitment to remain very accommodative and tolerant of a spike in inflation over its target. There could be other triggers — a continued rise in infections, especially more serious strains, or a slowdown in vaccine rollouts. We don’t know when this could occur — and while I believe it would be short-lived, I also believe it’s very important to be broadly diversified both across and within stocks, bonds, and alternatives.
While broad diversification is critical, investors could consider overweighting both the technology and consumer discretionary sectors within their equity sleeve. Both could serve different purposes in a portfolio — one offering some defensive qualities with the other offering the potential to participate in the recovery.

Key takeaways
Georgia’s special elections have implications for investors
The results could lead to additional fiscal spending, higher corporate taxes, changes to the Affordable Care Act, and more.
Is a divided government necessarily better for financial markets?
History shows that markets performed just fine during the last two instances of unified government.

In this time of great political divide, the one thing on which there seems to be broad agreement is that divided government has generally worked better for financial markets than one-party control. In the aftermath of the highly contested 2020 election, investors seemed to take solace in the belief that divided government would create the type of political gridlock that historically has tended to propel markets higher. The fact that US equity markets advanced nearly 11% in November 2020 and ended the year at record highs1 seemed to affirm the value of political checks and balances.
As the late great sportscaster and Georgia’s own Keith Jackson would say, “Hold the phone!” The polls appear to have tightened in the Georgia Senate special elections, and the oddsmakers now have the elections as virtual dead heats. Control of the Senate and investor expectations of divided government hang in the balance. 
What could the results mean for investors?
Investors can’t be blamed for feeling a bit of déjà vu as they are left once again to grapple with the potential implications of this election. Could today’s special elections lead to additional fiscal spending, higher corporate taxes, changes to the Affordable Care Act, and more? On the opening day of 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined nearly 400 points, which couldn’t have helped to ease investor concerns.2 Now what?
Lest investors get too uneasy, let’s remember that the markets performed just fine during the last two instances of unified government: 
1.  The S&P 500 Index returned 54% from the day Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009 with Democrat single-party rule to the day of the 2010 midterm election “shellacking” (Obama’s word, not mine), when voters once again opted for a divided government.3
2.  Markets also returned 25% under Republican single-party rule from Donald Trump’s inauguration day to the 2018 midterm election, when the Republicans lost control of the House.4
Market tailwinds remain in place
The same notable market tailwinds that we saw in 2009 — economic recovery, 0% interest rates, massive monetary policy accommodations, fiscal support, stocks cheap to bonds,5 inflation tempered by heightened unemployment, and the economy running below capacity — are in place today. If the Democrats manage to pull off the upsets in Georgia, then a key difference this time around, in my view, is that many of those same Democrat players who were there in 2009 would likely use their latest opportunity to advance greater fiscal spending to support the economic recovery. In a more pronounced economic recovery, we would expect an even further rise in Treasury rates, tightening of municipal and corporate bond spreads, weakening of the dollar, and higher performance of value stocks and emerging market equities. If the Republicans maintain control of the Senate and fiscal spending is tempered, then I would expect the economic recovery to be less robust and the value-oriented market recovery less pronounced.   
As for renewed concerns about potentially higher tax rates derailing the market advance, the same was said in 2009 and 2010, during the Obama-Biden administration. Back then, tax increases were put on the back burner in order to not derail a nascent economic expansion following the global financial crisis. I would expect a similar approach under a Biden administration. 
As for concerns that the policies of a unified Democratic government would be massively inflationary and crush market multiples — again, the same was said in 2009 and 2010. Today, the economy and markets are still facing deflationary forces. Note that the 10-year US Treasury rate has remained below 1%.6 We will assess again in the future, but I believe 2021 is unlikely to be the year to be concerned about taxes and/or inflation.   
Admittedly, all of this could be for naught. Upset victories by the Democrats in the Georgia special elections are by no means a foregone conclusion. Divided government might win the day. Either way, the market tailwinds expressed above do not change.  
The Georgia special election may feel like the Granddaddy of Them All, but with apologies to Keith Jackson, let’s keep it in proper perspective.

Key takeaways
S&P 500 Index investors are facing a historic level of concentration risk
The current concentration risk of the S&P 500 is just below the all-time high.
This risk may leave investors vulnerable
The amount of concentration risk is one that traditional passive investors haven’t faced in over four decades.
Investors may want to consider exploring diversification
An equal-weight approach could help mitigate concentration risk while maintaining exposure to US stocks.

In 2020, US equity markets have taken a path that few could have seen coming. As a result, the S&P 500 Index has become more top-heavy than it’s been in 45 years. Below, I explain why this is the case, what it means for investors — and what they can do to help mitigate this concentration risk while maintaining exposure to the companies that make up this well-known benchmark.

The S&P 500 Index is dominated by just five holdings
Since its low on March 23, the S&P 500 Index has recovered by nearly 50% on the back of historic government and central bank intervention.1 Not only has the index turned positive for the year, it is now rapidly closing in on its Feb. 19 high. During this year’s equity roller coaster ride, the five largest holdings in the S&P 500 Index — Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) have shone brightly.2 The average year-to-date return among these largest five holdings is more than 36%,1 driven by the perceived safety of owning the biggest companies as well as the importance of technology and communication services in the work-at-home/stay-at-home world suddenly thrust upon us by the Great Lockdown. 
Why is this outperformance by the mega caps important? Like many benchmark indexes, the S&P 500 uses market capitalization to weight securities. This means that despite the significant number of securities that are included, the risk and return of the index — and of the traditional index funds that track it — is driven by the largest holdings. The dominance of just a few large holdings on overall risk and return is called “concentration risk.”
The recent runup in these “biggest of the big” companies has created a situation in which the S&P 500 Index is more top-heavy than it has been in 45 years. As of Aug. 7, the top five stocks accounted for nearly 23% of the weight in the S&P 500 Index, up from 16.8% at the end of 2019 and widely surpassing the 16.6% observed in December 1999 (which was in the midst of the final build-up before the technology bubble burst in March 2000).3
Benchmark indexes face historic levels of concentration risk
As shown in the chart below, the current concentration risk of the S&P 500 is only a few percentage points from the high of 27.7% reached in 1964.3 This amount of concentration risk is one that traditional passive investors haven’t faced in over four decades. When concentration risk is the simple result of market capitalization (versus, for example, the intentional choices of an active manager), it may leave investors vulnerable in a few different scenarios: when valuations mean revert, when new competitors have a negative impact on the top companies, when regulatory risk emerges, and when the market experiences a rotation into more cyclical stocks. 
Concentration risk: The concentration in the top five holdings is nearly 23%, a level not seen since 1975
The light blue bar represents the current concentration figures as of Aug. 7. The red bar illustrates the last time that the concentration of the index’s top five holdings was this high.

Key takeaways
Petroleum products are wide-ranging
They are used in so many applications because petroleum can be engineered to serve a specific purpose.
Plastics are in high demand
They are expected to be the largest source of petroleum growth going forward.
The industry is looking for waste solutions
We expect sustained investment in recycling infrastructure and sustainable packaging in the near and long term.

We encounter petroleum1 products on an almost constant basis — like something as inconspicuous as an iPhone case or as essential as indoor plumbing. Though petroleum is synonymous with automobiles, this represents less than half of petroleum demand. Perhaps surprisingly, an almost equivalent amount of petroleum demand is derived from non-transportation sources. Where else do we encounter petroleum products? How about in milk cartons, golf balls, MRI scanners, lipstick, crayons, and solar panels?

Regardless of its ubiquity, petroleum is often vilified for its role in the environment, primarily from use as transportation fuel. Today, transportation accounts for 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with approximately two-thirds coming from cars and trucks.2 Agriculture, industrial, and power are all bigger emitters. As a feedstock for materials and polymers, the problem with petroleum here is not so much with emissions — since it is chemically reformulated versus combusted — but disposal. Though progress continues toward reducing the environmental impact, petroleum is nevertheless a vital component to a functioning global economy and to sustaining and improving living standards globally. In this article we explore the essential role of petroleum products, what is being done to minimize the negative impacts, and the practical reality of alternatives.
Petroleum meaningfully improves the standard of living for people globally
Petroleum is used as feedstock to make everyday products, ranging from products large and small, recreational and essential. Health care products include medicine bottles, IV bags, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and hand sanitizers. Recreational items include tents, bikes, canoes, rope, backpacks, and fishing poles. Other applications include detergents, home insulation, carpets, furniture, food packaging, diapers, and vehicle bumpers and instrument panels. The list is endless. Petroleum products are used in so many applications because it can be engineered — optimizing its features for being lightweight, durable, corrosion-resistant, and cost-effective — to serve a specific purpose.
But aside from these everyday, often mundane aspects, petroleum is essential in providing billions of people with humane living standards: clean water, sanitation, and clean burning fuel, to name a few. For example, petroleum is a feedstock to produce polyvinyl chloride, commonly known as PVC. Indoor plumbing and water infrastructure rely heavily on PVC pipe because of its durability, moldability, recyclability, and cost-effectiveness. Without PVC, more expensive alternative materials, such as steel or copper, would inhibit the proliferation of indoor plumbing and water infrastructure, specifically in developing nations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), two billion people still do not have basic sanitation facilities such as toilets or latrines, and without effective, low-cost materials such as PVC, these basic sanitation needs will go unmet much longer than necessary.
Propane is another example of petroleum being used to meaningfully improve lives. According to the WHO, approximately three billion people still cook with solid fuels such as wood, crop wastes, and dung. These cooking fuels are detrimental to people's health, with an estimated four million people dying prematurely each year from solid fuels.3 In India, approximately 78% of the population in 2015 used solid fuels, leading to an estimated half a million deaths a year, with women and young children the most vulnerable. In 2016 the Indian government launched Ujjwala, which provided both access and subsidies for propane. As a cooking fuel, it burns much cleaner and more efficiently than solid fuels. Since it was easily distributed in cannisters provided for free by the government, propane coverage has now reached approximately 90%, immediately improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people there. The Ujjwala program remains popular domestically. Today, India is amongst the largest propane importers, supplied in large part by US exports.

Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
Are we in the midst of a market bubble?
“Irrational exuberance” can lead to escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions.
Rising asset prices don’t equal a speculative bubble
Stocks might be rising in expectation of a strong period of economic growth as countries benefit from stimulus and the COVID-19 recovery.
Bubbles and contractions should be expected
It is inevitable for asset prices to experience cycles, and corrections are a natural part of them.


Weekly Market Compass: Has ""irrational exuberance"" gotten the better of markets?
One of the questions I have gotten a lot lately is: “Is the stock market in a speculative bubble?”
Well, let me try to answer that question based on my own experience. I entered the financial services industry in late 1995, a bright-eyed and eager runaway from the practice of law. Not soon afterward, I listened intently to a historic speech by then-Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, who suggested that the stock market was exhibiting “irrational exuberance.” More specifically, he asked the question, “How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions?” While Greenspan’s timing wasn’t perfect — the stock market continued to rise for several more years — it did suffer a major drop when the “tech bubble” burst in March 2000.
Robert Shiller expanded on this concept in his 2000 book Irrational Exuberance, in which he treated irrational exuberance as a critical part of a speculative bubble — the psychological basis of it, in fact. He defined it as “a situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process of amplifying stories that might justify the price increases, and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors who despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly by envy of others’ successes and partly through a gambler’s excitement.”
Well, that might not be a definition that works for many investors. After all, we know that there are really only two emotions that we encounter in the investing world: fear and greed — or, to put it more politely, optimism and pessimism. And I would argue that it is difficult to differentiate between optimism/greed and irrational exuberance. From my perspective, I think it’s helpful to look to Charles Kindleberger for guidance on what a speculative bubble is.
Kindleberger laid out the five stages of an asset bubble:
1.  Displacement: Some kind of catalyst occurs that is recognized by early investors (i.e., the “smart money”) which causes them to start investing in an industry, country, or theme.
2.  Boom: The narrative supporting the investment gains traction, and momentum grows.
3.  Euphoria: The media begins covering the investment more broadly, and everyone becomes aware of this compelling opportunity. In the 1990s, it was cab drivers investing in internet stocks; today, it is contractors investing in bitcoin and Instacart drivers investing in Gamestop. Momentum rises dramatically.
4.  Crisis: Early investors start to get out. The selling gains momentum as more investors exit the investment as prices move lower. The bubble bursts and “euphoria buying” is replaced by “panic selling.”
5.  Revulsion: Media coverage becomes broadly negative, the asset becomes very unloved, and it can fall to irrationally low levels.
I think it’s important to point out that although we often see the first two or three stages of Kindleberger’s model, we don’t always get to the fourth or fifth stage. For example, investors might lose interest in an industry or country or an investment theme, causing prices to stall — but not drop significantly. So, while those first few stages are prerequisites for a bubble, they are not determinant of whether or not we are in a bubble.

We could look to technical indicators for guidance. Typically, market technicians believe the following indicators are signs of a market top:

1.  The number of companies hitting 52-week highs declines.
2.  The market narrows. Broad indexes decline while more narrow indexes rise.
3.  Prices fail to make higher highs or create a lower low than the previous low in the uptrend. (This is considered the ultimate confirmation because it points to timing.)

Keep in mind the first two conditions can exist for a very long time and may not always lead to the third — and the correction that would presumably follow.

We can look to Hyman Minsky, a posthumously revered American economist, for some guidance. Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis can be applied to the investing world. Minsky posited that a substantial period of investment gains create an environment in which market participants have a diminished perception of overall market risk. This in turn can result in more speculative investing behavior. In the event of an asset price decline, investors might be forced to sell more liquid and less speculative investments, amplifying the market sell-off — creating a “Minsky Moment.”
We know financial conditions are supportive and investors have gotten more enthusiastic; and we know asset prices have risen. But this does not mean the stock market is in a speculative bubble. Stocks might be rising in expectation of a strong period of economic growth as many countries recover from the pandemic and benefit from greater fiscal and monetary stimulus. Stocks might also be rising because investing is all relative, and stocks and other risk assets are more attractive than sovereign debt and cash in a low rate environment (a concept referred to as “TINA” for “there is no alternative.”) Stocks might also be rising because discretionary spending has fallen and average household savings have risen in this pandemic, making more cash available for individuals to invest with.
The bottom line is that it is inevitable for asset prices to experience cycles, and corrections are a natural part of cycles. But that’s not a reason for investors to abandon stocks; in my view, it is a reason to be well-diversified across and within a variety of asset classes including fixed income and alternatives. And it is a reason to have a long time horizon. I think back to Alan Greenspan’s speech in 1996 — imagine if I had decided to stop investing in stocks because they were exhibiting “irrational exuberance” back then? 
For reference, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 6,437.10 and the S&P 500 Index closed at 744.38 on Dec 5, 1996 right before Fed Chair Greenspan’s famous speech that evening.1 Similarly, I think back to the dramatic sell-off of 2008-2009. Had I abandoned stocks as the sell-off began, I would be far worse off today.  For reference, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 10,917.51 and the S&P 500 Index closed at 1192.69 on Sep. 15, 20082 — the day Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, setting off widespread market panic. 
In other words, we don’t know if we are in a sustained rally or a speculative bubble until it is in the rear-view mirror — and it really doesn’t matter for longer-term investors. The reality is that market rallies and corrections occur (even Minsky moments will happen), but the trend line for stocks over the long run is upward.

Key takeaways
Where do we go from here?
Neither candidate has yet reached the 270-vote threshold in the Electoral College that is needed to win.
The victor will face four key challenges
COVID-19, China, taxes, and infrastructure could all impact the markets and economy.
Today’s uncertainty is unlikely to have a long-term market impact
The current political uncertainty is unlikely to change the trajectory of the economy and markets over the next years.

As of midnight EST Nov. 3, the 2020 presidential election remains up in the air. With ballots remaining to be counted in several states, an official result may not be known for some time. Below, our experts discuss the next steps in the political process, the policy issues that the markets will be watching, and two critical questions for investors to ask themselves right now.

The importance of the election process
Marty Flanagan, President and CEO, Invesco. While the US presidential election looked different this year, participating in the democratic process continues to be one of the most important responsibilities for all Americans. Participating in elections is one of the key freedoms for Americans, and it’s important that we allow the process to unfold, ensuring that the voice of the American people is heard.
The United States of America and the democratic process have endured times of uncertainty over our history, and I have complete confidence that we will do so again as the election results process continues.
The political process: What happens next?
Andy Blocker, Head of US Government Affairs: As of midnight EST on Nov. 3, the results of the election remain unclear. President Trump was able to hold onto many of the early reporting contested states that he won in 2016 – Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Ohio. And as of this hour, Arizona and North Carolina are still too close to call.
If President Trump is able to hold onto Arizona and North Carolina, it will be déjà vu all over again. This election will once again come down to the same rust belt states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that determined the 2016 election. As expected, they have yet to count all of their mail-in votes and are not ready to be called for either candidate. We would expect to have final results from Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday, but Pennsylvania will not have final results until Friday, the deadline for receiving mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania. As a result, at the time of this writing, neither candidate has yet reached the 270-vote threshold in the Electoral College that is needed to win.
Four policy issues the markets will be watching
Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist: Whoever prevails in this contested election will face significant challenges ahead. These are four areas I’ll be watching closely, due to their potential to impact markets and the economy:
1.  COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, I’ve written about the importance of a three-pronged policy response to coronavirus: 1) public health policy to contain the virus, 2) monetary measures to ensure financial liquidity and functionality, and 3) fiscal support to contain the real economic damage. The Federal Reserve has provided massive monetary policy accommodation throughout the crisis — but what about the other two prongs? 
In terms of public health policy, Trump has suggested he might pursue a “herd immunity” strategy if there is another resurgence of the virus. In contrast, Biden has suggested that if recommended by medical experts, he would be open to implementing another widescale lockdown similar to the one experienced last spring. These approaches have the potential to significantly impact economic activity.
In terms of fiscal support, I believe the next president needs to think of pandemic-related stimulus as akin to coupon payments on a bond. In other words, stimulus payments need to be adequate and at regular intervals in order for the economy to continue to be supported in the face of serious headwinds until an effective vaccine is developed and widely distributed.
2.  China. We will be very focused on the next president’s plans for engaging with China. The Trump administration’s approach has created significant volatility in markets, and there is fear that a second term would mean even more unpredictable and aggressive moves against China. On the other hand, there is some uncertainty about what a Biden administration might mean for the US-China relationship. In our view, there are two main possibilities: One is that a Biden presidency would hit the “reset” button on relations with China, while another is that Biden would continue to be aggressive with China, but in a more measured and multilateral way. 
3. Taxes. If Biden prevails, markets will be monitoring the potential for taxes to increase. He has said he wants to raise taxes, but when? Clearly the economic recovery is still very fragile, so raising taxes next year could be problematic, in our view. On the other hand, markets did not seem deterred by October polls that projected a decisive Biden victory. 
I believe one critical reason is that a “Blue Wave” could very well mean a large stimulus package in 2021 — and in the final weeks of the campaign, that seemed to outweigh concerns about an increase in corporate taxes.
4.  Infrastructure. This is one area that both candidates have said they would spend more on, but we haven’t gotten much in the way of details. I will be waiting for details from the next president on his infrastructure spending plan: the amount he plans to spend, how it will be financed, and perhaps even when it might be implemented. In the 1930s, government spending on infrastructure was used as a way to fight unemployment and put people back to work, and it was successful in reducing unemployment and helping the economy. Might the same be true going forward?
We have to recognize that market volatility is what we get when there is policy uncertainty, but we can’t let it shake us as we are experiencing this uncertainty against a backdrop of massive monetary policy accommodation, which has helped support stocks throughout the pandemic. While we work through the political and legal processes to determine the winner, I believe it is important to remain well diversified and stay the course — and of course to be on the outlook for opportunities if stocks experience any heavy bouts of downward volatility.
Two critical question for investors
Brian Levitt, Global Market Strategist: It’s officially the moment that many investors expected might occur. The outcome of the election is unknown and the counting may take some time.
It is said that the equity market and those who invest in it don’t like uncertainty, particularly policy uncertainty.  As a result, the potential for near-term bouts of equity market volatility may be elevated. Critically however, the current political uncertainty is unlikely to change the trajectory of the economy and markets over the next years, in my view.
Providing the obligatory historical perspective of contested US elections is challenging. After all, the grand experiment is only 245 years old, and the 1876 election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden may be of little significance to current investors. For what it’s worth, US large-cap equities fell 18% between the election of November 1876 and Hayes’ inauguration in March 1877, only to subsequently climb by 160% over his single term as president.1
In this century, the Nov. 7, 2000, election between George W. Bush and Al Gore didn’t have a victor declared until Dec. 13, 2000, when the US Supreme Court effectively ended the recount in Florida. The S&P 500 Index was down 4.9% between election day and the Supreme Court decision over a month later.2 Gold was up 3.9% over the same time frame, and the 10-year US Treasury rate fell 85 basis points from 5.85% to 5.00%.3 That’s not a great outcome but not a disaster either.
Notably, average market volatility in the 25 trading days between the 2000 election and the official result did not rise to the levels reached multiple times during the elongated business and market cycles of  2009-2019.4 In short, we have been through a lot of events in recent years that rattled markets more than the delayed election result of Bush v. Gore (see chart below). This includes, but is not limited to, the European debt crisis, the Chinese currency devaluation, the many shifts in US Federal Reserve policy, and the US-China trade war, not to mention the COVID-19 outbreak, which ultimately concluded the business cycle.

Key takeaways
Trump’s path to victory has narrowed
His campaign is filing lawsuits and requesting recounts.
What’s the status in battleground states?
We assess where things stand in key states, especially Pennsylvania.

But first will come recounts and lawsuits. We assess where things stand in the key battleground states.
Well, it’s all over but the shoutin’. In order for President Trump to remain in the White House, he will have to pull off a miracle in the remaining states that have yet to be called by a major network, and he will need to successfully navigate a recount process in Wisconsin (and perhaps elsewhere) better than any candidate in history, overturning tens of thousands of votes in his deficit. While we may face a few days or weeks of controversy and litigation, the signs point to Joe Biden becoming the next president of the United States. 
I expect that outcome to soon become clear, but first we must address the noise coming from the Trump campaign. What form do their legal challenges take in the key battlegrounds, and what exactly is at the center of their case? Further, what is the process and timeline for resolution? Here is the breakdown1:
Pennsylvania
At this stage, we see the most viable challenge to ballots would be the case in Pennsylvania, in which the Trump campaign is attempting to invalidate mail-in ballots received after 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, Election Day. Even though ballots postmarked on Election Day are eligible to be received as late as this Friday at 5:00 p.m., this has been challenged, and it is possible that the US Supreme Court could take up this case.

However, we see a few hurdles before the Supreme Court would consider taking up this case:

The Supreme Court would want to make sure that Pennsylvania is determinative to who wins the presidential election. If President Trump fails to turn Arizona back into his camp or cannot hold onto Georgia, the prevailing wisdom is that the Supreme Court would be hesitant to get involved in a state election issue that is not consequential.
The Supreme Court would also want to see if the counting of these contested ballots was determinative to the outcome in Pennsylvania. If Joe Biden wins Pennsylvania without the ballots in question, there would be no harm to remedy.

Key takeaways
Contested elections are not unprecedented
Contested US presidential elections have happened in 1876 and in 2000.
Could 2020 be added to that list?
Now there is concern that 2020 could be another contested election, but that it might not be as civilized and polite as 2000.
What is ahead for this week?
Likely more investor indigestion, and not just from the US presidential election.

Weekly Market Compass: The US has survived contested elections and unrest before
Well, last week was in fact a Pepto Bismol kind of week,  just as I had expected. No fiscal stimulus in the US, COVID-19 cases on the rise in Europe and the US, and growing concerns about the US presidential election. It’s no wonder that the VIX volatility index has risen dramatically in the last few weeks, from 25 on Oct. 9 to 38 on Oct. 30.1 As I’ve said before, today’s election concerns aren’t your usual run-of-the-mill worries like we saw in past election cycles. Past questions focused on issues such as “What happens to stocks if corporate taxes go up?” This time around, it is “What happens if there is a contested election?” and “What happens if there is civil unrest?""
A history of contested elections
Contested presidential elections have happened before. Not just in 2000, but in 1876. That was the contest between Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican nominee, and Samuel Tilden, the Democratic nominee.2 Tilden won the popular vote and led with more electoral votes (185-184), but there was a dispute over four states’ electoral votes. In three of those states (Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina), Tilden appeared to win the popular vote, but there were reports of widespread electoral fraud and voter intimidation against Hayes supporters. One fraudulent tactic was to confuse illiterate voters into supporting Tilden by using revered Republican President Abraham Lincoln’s picture next to Tilden’s name. As such, those three states disqualified Democratic votes — but this was not without controversy. For example, the state of Florida produced two slates of electors — one slate for Tilden, one slate for Hayes. In Oregon, Hayes won the popular vote and therefore the state’s electoral votes, but one of his electors in that state was disputed, as the Democratic governor removed him for violating Constitutional requirements and replaced him with a Democratic elector. In the midst of this dispute, a protester fired a rifle into the home of the Republican candidate Hayes.
After competing slates of electors for these states were sent to Congress, Congress attempted to resolve this election dispute between Tilden and Hayes by creating an “electoral commission” comprised of five Supreme Court justices, five representatives, and five senators. The political climate became very tense, leading General William Sherman to order troops to Washington, D.C., to maintain order. Militant Democrats warned of blood in the streets if Tilden did not become president, and headlines screamed, “Tilden or War!” 
The electoral commission decided in February 1877 that Rutherford B. Hayes would be the next president. However, Democrats were incensed by the decision and attempted a filibuster to prevent Congress from accepting the commission’s decision and prevent Hayes’ inauguration. The standoff finally led to the Compromise of 1877, an attempt to placate Tilden supporters so that they would support Hayes’ presidency. In return for accepting the electoral commission’s decision to name him as the next president, Hayes agreed to the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, which in effect ended Reconstruction. However, the situation was so politically charged that there was an attempted assassination of Hayes during the inauguration festivities. Despite that troubling start, Hayes served one term as president and, despite continued grumbling about his legitimacy from Tilden supporters, presided over a relatively peaceful period in the nation’s history.
That particular scenario won’t happen again because soon after the dispute, Congress passed the Electoral Count Act of 1887. While flawed, it provides more specific guidance on how to manage a dispute over electoral votes. We of course experienced another contested election in 2000. It was a very civilized affair in comparison to 1876. In a little over a month after election day, the Supreme Court decided the victor, George W. Bush, and no compromise had to be offered to Democrats to placate them. 
Concerns about civil unrest ahead
Now there is concern that there could be another contested election, but that it might not be as civilized and polite as 2000 — and in fact might lead to civil unrest. I believe there is some validity to these concerns. After all, last week Wal-Mart was so concerned about the potential for civil unrest that it made the decision to temporarily remove guns and ammunition from store aisles in order to prevent the theft of these weapons if stores are looted, although it reversed the decision the next day.3 And on Friday, the Biden campaign cancelled a rally in Texas because Trump supporters surrounded the Biden bus, allegedly ramming a Biden-supporting car traveling alongside the bus and holding up traffic.4 In addition, businesses in a number of cities are boarding up windows in preparation for civil unrest.5 Finally, it is expected that the federal government will re-install a “non-scalable fence” around the White House today, in preparation for the possibility of unrest (the fence had been temporarily installed this summer during Black Lives Matter protests, but had since been removed).6  
Well, it might be both sad and reassuring to know there is a long history of American civil unrest around elections. For example, in the 1850s, the Know-Nothing Party supported the use of violence in order to prevent immigrants from voting. This was not a fringe movement — this was a powerful political party, with members holding 22% of the seats in Congress in 1854.7 In Baltimore, there was a bloody clash between the Know-Nothing Party and the Democratic Party that resulted in the deaths of eight people. In 1855, there was an even bloodier episode of civil unrest in which the Know-Nothing Party was involved, resulting in the killings of 22 people, most of whom were German and Irish immigrants.8
Arguably the biggest incidence of civil unrest was the Civil War, which got its start in 1860 with the refusal of southern states in the US to accept the results of the presidential election. But it didn’t stop there. However, historically we have seen a disconnect between civil unrest and the stock market. I look to 1968 as a guide as it was a period of very serious civil unrest. As is the case today, there were deep divisions in the US around critical issues such as the Vietnam War and civil rights in the 1960s. Much of it came to a head in 1968, a year when opposition to the Vietnam War became so powerful that incumbent President Lyndon Johnson made the surprise decision to not seek another presidential term. This was a year when civil rights icon Martin Luther King was assassinated, as was Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. There was rioting in many cities for months, including at the Democratic National Convention. And yet the stock market was largely divorced from this civil unrest and actually finished the year in positive territory.9
We have to recognize that America has a long history of violence surrounding elections, which has the potential to rear its ugly head again, especially in a period of heightened tensions and a pandemic. The good news is that, despite this history, democracy in America has survived. And while many are concerned about controversy and unrest surrounding the 2020 US election, I believe that the checks and balances we have in place will lead us through. From an investment perspective, I expect things like innovation and business fundamentals to drive the stock market in the long term, despite any shorter-term volatility that may arise.
Looking ahead
So what is ahead for this week? Likely more investor indigestion, and not just from the US presidential election. We now know more definitively than ever that fiscal help is not on the way in the US in the near term. But what’s worse is that the second wave of COVID-19 has arrived, and it’s bad enough to warrant significant lockdowns in Europe.
Over the weekend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a second lockdown in the UK in an attempt to control an alarming rise in COVID-19 infections. Johnson said that England will close all nonessential businesses for the next four weeks — although it will keep schools open. This means people must stay at home except for the purposes of education, medical treatment, or grocery shopping. Since then, British citizens have been put on notice that the lockdown may need to last more than a month. Keep in mind that not too long ago, the British government was incentivizing citizens to eat out with government subsidies; now it has closed all pubs and restaurants for dining, and they can only provide takeout or delivery.10 What we learned in the spring is that Europe’s present can be the US’s future in just a few weeks, and the prospect of a lockdown in the US could really rattle investors and send stocks down even further.
Heading toward Election Day on Tuesday — and the potentially tumultuous days after — I favor staying the course and maintaining a long-term asset allocation. If you’re sitting on cash that you are looking to deploy, you may find some attractive opportunities this week and possibly in the weeks ahead. And finally, stay calm — I plan to have some wine and chocolate on hand alongside my Pepto Bismol.

Key takeaways
Could taxes rise?
Many investors are concerned that the Biden administration may eventually implement tax increases.
These asset classes may help
REITs and MLPs could potentially help minimize the adverse impact of any such tax hikes.

Benjamin Franklin once quipped that “nothing is certain except death and taxes.”1 While we have no opinion on the former, we can offer some suggestions on the latter. This is especially true since President Joe Biden, while on the campaign trail, repeatedly promised that he would raise taxes for corporations and wealthy individuals. Because Congress can use special budget procedures to pass tax increases without the need for 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster, we believe it is likely that the Biden administration will eventually push through a series of tax increases. Fortunately for investors, there are two asset classes that could potentially help minimize the adverse impact of any such tax hikes — real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs).
Amplifying the positive
Both REITs and MLPs are pass-through entities that typically pay no taxes at the corporate level. Instead, income from these investments is taxed only once at the shareholder level, thereby eliminating the much-criticized double taxation of corporate profits. When the Trump administration cut the top tax rates for companies and individuals through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), it reduced the relative tax advantage of these investment vehicles compared to traditional C-corporations. If the Biden administration raises taxes, it would amplify the relative tax advantage of REITs and MLPs.
Low rates likely to rise
US corporate tax rates have varied widely over time but have averaged 32.5% for the last 110 years.2 The current rate is 21%, having been reduced from a graduated maximum rate of 35% at the start of 2018.3 Of course, these are the statutory rates prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The effective tax rates that companies actually pay are typically much lower as a result of the many deductions, credits and loopholes contained in the tax code. In fact, the average effective tax rate for corporations was approximately 19% prior to passage to the TCJA, and fell to roughly 13% in 3Q 2020 following the Trump tax cuts.4
Regardless of the precise amount, two things are clear — US tax rates are the lowest they have been in a long time, and the Biden administration intends to increase those rates
Biden tax plan
We believe the new administration may try to use special budget procedures to pass a tax increase with a simple majority vote, just as President Bill Clinton did in 1993. The Biden tax plan has many elements but its key proposals5 are to:

Increase the corporate rate from 21% to 28%.
Add a 15% minimum tax to ensure larger firms pay at least some taxes.
Eliminate the qualified business income (QBI) deduction for pass-throughs entities for individuals making over $400,000.
Increase the top individual tax rate from 37% to 39.6%.
Tax long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at ordinary income rates for those making over $1 million in income. 
For purposes of this article, we will focus on the implications of these five proposed changes for investors in REITs, MLPs and C-corps.

Potentially widening the tax advantage
Since REITs and MLPs are typically exempt from paying taxes at the entity level, they generally have more cash flow available for discretionary uses — including paying distributions to investors. Under current law, the tax advantage of investing in REITs and MLPs compared to C-corps is attractive. In fact, many investors in these pass-through vehicles typically enjoy a 7.2% tax rate advantage over C-corp investors: 29.6% for REITs/MLPs versus 36.8% for C-corps.6 If the Biden tax plan is enacted as proposed, the relative advantage could widen to as much as 16.9%: 39.6% for REITs/MLPs vs. 56.5% for C-corps.7 (This simplified analysis is designed solely for illustrative purposes, and does not represent tax advice; the actual amounts that taxpayers might owe depend on a number of factors and could vary greatly.)
Simply put, taxes would go up for both sets of investors under the Biden plan, but they would go up more for C-corp investors. The reason why is that the proposed increase in the corporate and qualified dividend rates for C-corp investors would more than offset a repeal of the QBI deduction and an increase in the top tax rate for REIT/MLP investors. The higher the corporate tax rate goes, the larger the potential advantage of pass-through entities.
Real estate sector would be a relative beneficiary
According to a recent analysis by Bank of America Global Research, the estimated impact to the S&P 500 from the Biden tax plan would be a drop in overall earnings by 7.1%.8 While all sectors would suffer a decline in earnings according to that analysis, not all would suffer equally. In fact, the sector least negatively impacted by the Biden tax plan would be real estate, where earnings would decline by an estimated 0.8%.9 (See Chart 1.) (The energy sector in this analysis excludes MLPs since there are no MLPs in the S&P 500 Index.) On the other end of the spectrum, the sectors with their earnings most negatively impacted would be information technology (-9.2%), health care (-8.4%) and communications services (-8.2%).

Key takeaways
Midstream equities performed better than expected in January
The sector’s early financial results from the fourth quarter have been beating consensus expectations.
Upstream activity has been rising
The frac spread count, an important proxy for future production, almost quadrupled off the May 2020 low-point.

Midstream equities outperformed the broader markets in January as the sector began reporting fourth-quarter financial results with early results coming in better than consensus expectations from market participants and up from the prior quarter. Upstream activity continues to grind higher, with the most important proxy for future production, the frac spread count, having almost quadrupled off the May 2020 low point.
MLP market overview
Midstream MLPs, as measured by the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), ended January up 4.8% on a price basis and up 5.8% after distributions are considered. The AMZ outperformed the S&P 500 Index’s 1.1% total return loss for the month.

MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-year US Treasury bond, narrowed by 132 basis points (bps) over the month, exiting the period at 890 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 693 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 422 bps. The AMZ indicated distribution yield at month-end was 10.0%.
Midstream MLPs and affiliates raised no new marketed equity (common or preferred, excluding at-the-market programs) and $5.6 billion of debt during the month. No new asset acquisitions were announced in January.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil exited the month at $52.20 per barrel, up 7.6% over the period and 1.2% higher year-over-year. Natural gas prices ended January at $2.56 per million British thermal units (MMbtu), up 1.0% over the month and 39.3% higher than January 2020. Natural gas liquids (NGL) pricing at Mont Belvieu exited the month at $30.04 per barrel, 21.6% higher than the end of December and 47.6% higher than the year-ago period.
News
Fourth-quarter earnings season kicks off. Fourth quarter reporting season began in January. Through month-end, 46 midstream entities had announced distributions for the quarter, including seven distribution increases and 39 distributions that were unchanged from the previous quarter. Through the end of January, only two sector participants had reported fourth-quarter financial results. Operating performance has been, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, coming in 2.1% higher than consensus estimates and 6.6% higher than the preceding quarter.

Biden presses the pause button. President Joe Biden’s “Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” includes a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands while a comprehensive review of oil and gas permitting and leasing is conducted. The review is not expected to have any significant impact on near-term producer activity, as producers typically carry years of permits. In our view, while the result of the review is unclear, federal lands represent a small portion of onshore production, and any future drilling restrictions would most likely result in a shift in the location of future drilling activity as opposed to a significant reduction in total production. Further, certain states are highly dependent on federal land-related oil and gas production for tax revenue and employment, such as New Mexico, which derives about one-third of its budget from direct oil and gas royalty revenue, and so most observers expect something less than an outright prohibition and more likely increased oversight on existing leases and more onerous terms on new leases.

Permian highway placed into service. Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) commenced commercial service on the Permian Highway Pipeline (PHP) in January. PHP provides approximately 2.1 billion cubic feet per day of incremental natural gas capacity out of the Permian Basin transporting gas to markets along the Gulf Coast and Mexico. KMI operates the pipeline, which is also owned by EagleClaw Midstream (private), Altus Midstream (NYSE: ATLM), and an affiliate of an anchor shipper on the pipeline.

GMLP gets acquired by NFE. New Fortress Energy Inc. (Nasdaq: NFE) announced dual corporate acquisitions including the purchase of Golar LNG Partners (Nasdaq: GMLP) and Hygo Energy Transition, a joint venture between Golar LNG Limited (Nasdaq: GLNG) and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners. NFE is a global energy infrastructure company that operates as an integrated gas-to-power company; thus the addition of GMLP’s fleet of six floating storage and regasification units, four LNG carriers, and a 50% interest in Trains 1 and 2 of the Hilli, a floating liquefaction vessel, is expected to support both NFE’s existing facilities and international project pipeline.
Chart of the month: Oil and gas activity continues steady recovery
Producer operating activity has continued its steady upward pace since the sharp macro-induced declines experienced in early 2020. While the rig count has only rebounded partially, the frac spread count has almost quadrupled off the lows of May 2020. While each is a reliable measure of industry activity, we believe that frac spreads (the equipment necessary to complete and place a new well into production) are more indicative of future production than rig count. Additionally, due to the nuances of the respective contracts for each activity, frac spreads were reduced faster than rigs as industry slowed; therefore the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs), which we feel was already robust, increased in mid-2020 and is expected to be worked down over the next few years.

Our consistent focus on structural growth trends served us well 


During an extremely volatile year dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the consistency of our philosophy and process continued to serve us and our investors well. The pandemic forcefully reminded us that events do not change trends; they only accelerate or decelerate them. Many of the structural trends that accelerated during the year are trends in which we have long been invested, including:

Buying online
Working remotely
Using social media
Streaming entertainment at home
Employing more technology in medical research, treatment, patient management, and communication

New buying opportunities emerged
The dramatic sell-off that global equity markets experienced in March 2020 provided a once-in-a-decade opportunity to initiate positions at attractive prices in companies that had been on our watchlist for years, including:

Classic quality growth compounders with very high market share, growing sales, and stable, high returns on capital
Leading edge companies with the potential to succeed by disrupting their industries
Companies that we believe will rebound with even a moderate return to normalcy following the pandemic (We know people will return to attending the theater, sporting events, and restaurants, as they have done for hundreds of years.)

2021 and beyond
Looking ahead to 2021, we believe pent-up demand will drive rapid growth and step changes in secular trends will persist. Over the medium term, we believe growth stocks will continue to outperform value stocks. We note that, in many ways, equities are priced for a perfect exit from the COVID-19 crisis and any less positive outcome will lead to disappointment and a possible correction. Regardless of short-term market trends, we will adhere to our discipline of investing in companies that can sustainably monetize our structural investment themes for many years.

Jeff Feng
Senior Portfolio Manager


China is entering its fifth decade after the first reforms of the Deng Xiaoping era, and the conventional view among global investors, even emerging markets specialists, is that the economy is mature and growth avenues are mostly exhausted. The argument is that “miraculous” growth (to borrow former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers’ term), driven by a favorable demographic engine and credit-fueled investment in housing and infrastructure construction, is unsustainable and even has to be “paid back” with depressed growth levels going forward. While there are elements of truth to this perspective, it is too simplistic and can lead investors to miss important long-term opportunities. A holistic view shows that robust, higher-quality future growth may be achieved through a better balance between trade, domestic consumption, and investment.
 
In this article, we discuss:



China’s growth in the short, medium, and long term
Infrastructure development and the increasing productivity from robotics, automation, education, and training
Middle class consumption and attracting foreign multinational corporations
Financial reform and innovation

Our Q1 2021 multi-sector outlook assesses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the US election on our macro factor framework, asset allocation, and risk position.
Macro factor summary
We continue to expect growth expectations to bounce back strongly in 2021 as a result of vaccine distribution and large stimulus packages. Although base effect should push up inflation in the first half of 2021, we expect inflation to remain well contained in the medium term due to excess capacity in the service sector and residual impacts of COVID-19.
Asset allocation summary
Our macro factor framework suggests neutral positions in global duration and credit, and an underweight position in the US dollar.
Risk position summary
Underlying growth momentum is relatively supportive for risk-taking, but valuations are tight, in our view. We prefer to stay neutral in risky assets and use sell-offs as an opportunity to buy risky markets that we believe will be supported by the fundamentals in the medium term.

Key takeaways
The US federal budget deficit is widening
The government continues to spend to support the economy while collecting less revenue.
The Biden administration is proposing tax increases
These tax increases are designed to generate revenue and to reduce the income gap between the nation’s higher and lower earners.
Markets have generally performed well in different tax regimes
There is little in the historical data to suggest that the US equity market has been primarily driven by tax code changes.

The US federal budget deficit is widening, and the Biden administration is proposing tax increases. What might this mean for markets? As this article explains, history shows us that the US equity market has generally performed well in different tax regimes.
The problem
The US federal government has already committed over $3 trillion in spending to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, and President Joe Biden’s administration is currently seeking an additional $1.9 trillion in spending.1
At the same time, the federal government has been collecting less revenue as a result of the weakness in economy activity. The upshot is a substantial widening of the US federal budget deficit.

Key takeaways
Rates to remain lower for longer
Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jay Powell reassured markets that the Fed will not tighten monetary policy any time soon.
Yields to remain scarce
In my view, this is a time for investors to consider dividend-paying stocks.
GameStop rattles the markets
Market speculation has been top of mind for investors this week given what is happening with GameStop.

Weekly Market Compass: Market speculation hit a new level this week with GameStop, and the Fed threw cold water on inflation concerns.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) met last week and, as I expected, Fed Chair Jay Powell reassured markets that it doesn’t have a trigger finger when it comes to inflation. In his press conference following the meeting, Powell showed concern that the economic recovery had moderated and stressed that it was more dangerous to do too little than to do too much to support the economy (a sentiment echoed by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week as well). He underscored that the Fed will not tighten monetary policy any time soon. For income investors, the key takeaway is that we find ourselves mired in a yield-scarce environment for a variety of income-producing asset classes for what is likely to be some time to come.
Powell throws cold water on inflation concerns
Powell said he expects inflation to rise as a result of base effects — distorted comparisons to abnormally low year-ago numbers — but that the Fed will assume it is transitory and will not react to it. “As we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we’ll see measured 12-month inflation move up a few tenths,” Powell said. “… That’s a transient thing that we think will pass.”
He also stressed that the Fed would not react to a rise in inflation once vaccines are broadly distributed and the economy rebounds more robustly: “There’s also the possibility … that as the economy fully re-opens, there’ll be a burst of spending because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation,” Powell said. “Now, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large. So the way we would react is we’re going to be patient.”
Powell went one step further and threw cold water on concerns that there will be a significant and sustainable rise in inflation. He explained that while inflation dynamics evolve over time, they “don’t change rapidly.” He stressed that there has been significant disinflationary pressure for several decades and so it is very unlikely that a “troubling” level of inflation would emerge. And if we consider the key factors that drive higher levels of inflation, at the top of the list is a rise in unit labor costs. However, there is a large amount of slack still in the labor market, suggesting that will not happen any time soon. In other words, I expect the fed funds rate to stay put for at least 2021. And while the 10-year US Treasury yield rose significantly early in January, it has since fallen slightly, and is still at a relatively low 1.07%.1
Time to consider dividends for income?
As I mentioned at the outset, we find ourselves mired in a yield-scarce environment for a variety of income-producing asset classes for what is likely to be some time to come. And so in my view, this is a time for investors to consider dividend-paying stocks in order to augment income from traditional sources. Here are just a few other reasons to consider dividend-paying stocks:

Corporate earnings and cash flow have improved, so I believe the major dividend cuts we saw last year are over. We have actually seen some dividend increases in this environment.
Dividends tend to force discipline on companies that pay them because they are a major cash commitment; that can mean that companies are more selective in the projects that they do take on. That can result in a higher return on equity.
Dividend-paying stocks tend to exhibit substantially less volatility than non-dividend-paying stocks.2 That’s because investors are less likely to sell stocks that pay dividends in difficult times because they are still receiving dividend income.

Market speculation hits a new level with GameStop
Low yields on traditional sources of income is just one of the effects — a necessary evil — of very accommodative monetary policy. Another effect is market speculation, which has been top of mind for investors this week given what is happening with GameStop.
So, what happened?
GameStop has been experiencing challenges given its “Old Economy” business model — operating video game stores typically located within shopping malls. But for more than a year, a small but devoted group of investors bought GameStop stock and call options and talked it up on social media sites such as Reddit. This caused its fan base — and retail investor base — to grow. Excitement also built around other stocks currently facing headwinds, such as AMC, Blackberry, and others.
Then, these investors noticed that many hedge funds had shorted GameStop’s stock — meaning that their positions would profit if the stock price fell. This is a common tactic in the hedge fund world for turning profits; however, it can backfire if the stock price goes up. Small investors spread the word over social media, bought up GameStop stock, and pushed the stock price higher in order to create a “short squeeze” on hedge funds. In other words, these hedge funds were compelled to buy the stock in order to cover their short positions before their losses grew further, and that added buying activity compounded the stock’s meteoric rise.
So far, small investors have driven up GameStop from a market capitalization of less than $1 billion in the summer of 2020 to more than $22 billion currently.3 Because of the volatility in GameStop and other stocks, some trading platforms have limited retail traders’ ability to trade, a move that has been very controversial. Volatility in the overall stock market last week was partially blamed on the speculative behavior involving these stocks.
Is further volatility ahead?
There is concern that this level of speculation in markets could create more volatility and instability, and suggests that markets are frothy. After all, it’s not just a handful of stocks with challenging business models that have been bid up dramatically — it’s also cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. I think we need to recognize that extremely accommodative monetary policy can often create unintended consequences such as froth and speculation in some small corners of the investing universe. It’s happened before and it is likely to happen again.
We have to keep in mind that in general, stock market fundamentals are solid. Earnings season has been good thus far with 82% of S&P 500 Index companies that have reported delivering a positive earnings per share surprise, and 76% that have reported delivering a positive revenue surprise.4 Vaccines are starting to be distributed in a number of countries and, while there will likely be some speed bumps along the way, we expect a strong economic rebound once they are broadly available. In my view, investors should not get distracted from focusing on their financial goals by worrying about what is going on in small portions of the investing universe, even if at times it can create broader volatility.

Key takeaways
Stocks remain resilient
Despite a destabilizing attack on American democracy, markets barely flinched the first week of 2021. But why not?
Are better days ahead?
I believe stocks were looking ahead to better days of COVID vaccines, government stimulus, and a robust economic recovery.
The reflation trade looks likely to continue
Markets expect a strong recovery this year after some early headwinds, which could support the reflation trade.

Weekly Market Compass: It was a week of surprise, horror, and disappointment. Why didn't stocks react?
The past week has been a momentous one, to say the least. It was filled with surprise, horror, and disappointment - certainly in the US, but also for those watching around the world. I received a number of questions about how the stock market could be up in a week like this one. Let me try to explain.
We have to recognize that the stock market has had an upward bias that was created long before the November election, driven by strong monetary policy accommodation from the Federal Reserve. Then we learned in the fourth quarter that multiple vaccines had been developed that were effective in protecting against COVID-19. That is a gamechanger and creates a lot more confidence in an economic recovery in 2021, which in turn is obviously a powerful catalyst for stocks. And so, I believe stocks looked at events and data this week through the lens of positive bias.
Surprise
First came the Georgia Senate elections on Jan. 5. The Democratic sweep came as a surprise to so many; it is certainly not what we would have predicted in November. Our early election analysis focused on what investors might expect from a divided government. Now, we turn our sights to what’s possible under a unified government led by the Democrats.
Clients have asked how the stock market can rally with a unified Democratic government, especially since the stock market typically rewards divided governments. While divided government has typically appealed to markets, I would argue that it’s perhaps better to have a unified government in a time of crisis — which I believe markets are recognizing. The US is facing a massive health and economic crisis, and so the ability to get nominees confirmed and to legislate is important. But keep in mind this is a razor-thin margin, which is likely to ensure most legislation is in the “center lane” for America.
My colleague Andy Blocker, Head of US Government Affairs for Invesco, provided a list of two categories: things that are “now possible” and “not possible” given the Senate results.
Now possible
(1)   Once inaugurated, President-elect Biden should be able to get his full Cabinet confirmed in a timely fashion.
(2)   A second round of COVID-19 relief and assistance is widely expected to be larger and contain state and local assistance.
(3)   A robust infrastructure package is now more possible and will likely include green initiatives.
(4)   Tax increases to help pay for infrastructure are now possible starting with corporate taxes, with a chance for other targeted tax increases.
Still not possible
(1)   The Senate filibuster will stay in place. Senator Joe Manchin has already stated that he will not vote to get rid of the filibuster for legislative items.
(2)   Keeping the filibuster prevents “packing” the Supreme Court (increasing the number of seats on the court and filling them with Biden nominees) and prevents statehood for the District of Columbia or Puerto Rico.
(3)   We don’t expect a Green New Deal, even though there may be attempts to intersperse green initiatives in various bills as they are considered.
(4)   We also don’t expect Medicare for All. President-elect Biden does not support it, and even if he did, there are not the votes among Democrats in the Senate to pass it, in our view.
Horror
As the US was learning the election results, then came the heinous and violent takeover of the US Capitol. Despite such a destabilizing attack on American democracy, markets barely flinched. But why not?
I believe stocks were looking ahead to better days, expecting a robust economic recovery once there is broad distribution of vaccines — and anticipating more stimulus given the outcome of the Georgia Senate races. As my colleague Brian Levitt aptly put it, “I take solace in the system holding, democracy prevailing, and the markets focusing on persistent tailwinds.” I couldn’t agree more.
Disappointment
And then finally, on Friday, we got the US jobs reports for December, which showed a decline in monthly payrolls for the first time since the recovery started. It reminded us of the terrible impact of rising COVID-19 infections, which can easily derail a nascent recovery. I was not surprised by this report. The US has allowed the economy to be damaged by withholding stimulus for so long. I believe the K-shaped recovery is going to get worse before it gets better — but it should get better later in 2021.
If markets were surprised by the jobs report, they didn’t show it. In fact, stocks reacted positively, as it adds to the potential for more stimulus.
Later in the day on Friday, we learned that Senator Manchin opposes an additional $2,000 stimulus check, and that briefly pushed stocks lower before an aide walked the comments back and stocks breathed a sigh of relief.  As I have said before, the current environment necessitates ongoing fiscal stimulus until vaccines are broadly distributed and the economy can fully re-open. I expect that to happen.
Key takeaway
In terms of market implications from this week, the key takeaway, in my view, is that the reflation trade should continue because markets expect a strong recovery this year after some early headwinds. I believe the recovery is now likely to have additional support behind it given the election outcome this week, which I would expect to benefit cyclical and smaller-cap stocks. Cyclical momentum should also help drive the 10-year US Treasury yield modestly higher, although we continue to expect modest inflation.
As we have seen time and time again, even horror and disappointment can be overlooked by markets when monetary conditions are supportive. And that is certainly true of 2021 so far.

Key takeaways
Economic pressure
I believe that things are likely to get worse before they get better in the Western world, especially in the US.
Vaccine progress
While the vaccine situation is not perfect, it is very good compared to just a few months ago.
Pent-up demand
I believe there is a tightly coiled spring of pent-up demand, and I expect it to uncoil powerfully as broad vaccine distribution is achieved.

Weekly Market Compass: Western economies may get worse before they get better
While I have never lived in Florida, I have spent enough time there since childhood to be familiar with a weather phenomenon referred to as “the mean season.” It describes a brutal weather pattern that typically occurs in the late summer months. Hot, humid mornings are often followed by severe thunderstorms in the afternoon, which blow in from the ocean. However, the rain does not alleviate the heat — it actually exacerbates the heat in the evening, setting the stage for another hot, humid morning to follow. Hurricanes and tropical storms are sprinkled throughout the season, making it even more difficult. Throughout this oppressive weather pattern, there is typically no relief from the heat — and it can last for a month or more. Hence the term “the mean season.”
Well, after a devastating year, some parts of the world are entering a very mean season, and they are unlikely to get a reprieve for some time. But the problem is far worse than bad weather: COVID-19. Medical experts have warned about a second wave for some time, but it is already proving to be worse than many expected.
The biggest problem right now is in the US, where the number of daily new confirmed COVID cases is heading into the stratosphere at well over 500 per million people (Canada is also experiencing a rise in cases, albeit at a much lower growth level).1  Last week, Robert Redfield, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned of “rough times” in December, January and February for the US. He ominously said that he expects it will be “the most difficult times in the public health history of this nation” with the potential for close to 450,000 COVID-19 deaths by February, unless Americans adopt more recommended precautions.2
Some countries in Europe and in the UK have “bent the curve” after significant infection increases. Yet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson similarly warned that “we must first navigate a hard winter” of restrictions to try to curb the virus until a vaccine is broadly distributed.3
Western economies may get worse before they get better
We are already starting to see the effects of rising COVID-19 infections on various economies. In the eurozone, Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMI) for November are down from October: the IHS Markit Eurozone Composite PMI clocked in at 45.3, which is down significantly from October’s reading of 50.0.4 Not surprisingly, it was services that suffered, down sharply from the previous month. As Chris Williamson from IHS Markit explained, “The eurozone economy slipped back into a downturn in November as governments stepped up the fight against COVID-19, with business activity hit once again by new restrictions to fight off second waves of virus infections.”4 I agree with his assessment that the fourth quarter “will nevertheless likely see the eurozone economy take another major step backwards.”
In the most recent Federal Reserve Beige Book, four of 12 Fed districts reported “little or no growth” since the last Beige Book period. Philadelphia and three of the Midwestern Districts reported that “activity began to slow in early November as COVID-19 cases surged.”5 The November jobs report for the US also indicated slowing economic growth. Only 245,000 jobs were added last month, well below consensus expectations of 450,000 to 600,000.6 What’s more, it is a dramatic drop from October’s 610,000 jobs created.6 I expect December’s US jobs report to be far worse, given that the rise in COVID-19 cases got more severe in the back half of November (which is not reflected in the November jobs report).
Canada is also showing signs of a slowing economy. While its job creation beat expectations, jobs created are down from October and are at the lowest level in the six months since the recovery began.7
I believe that things are likely to get worse before they get better in the Western world, especially in the US. While medical professionals have learned more about treating the virus, leading to a relatively low mortality rate, hospitalizations are on the rise in the US. And that means that government officials who publicly stated their opposition to lockdowns are being forced to impose them, with more metro areas in the US announcing lockdowns over the past several days. For example, this past weekend lockdowns were announced for both the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas, which represents a substantial portion of US GDP. I expect that even people who aren’t in areas under lockdown will curtail their behavior and reduce mobility, also negatively impacting economic activity. I wouldn’t be surprised to see weaker job creation — if any — in the next several US employment reports as the US moves deeper into this “mean season.”
Vaccine progress continues
But just as Floridians know the mean season will end one day soon, we too know that one day vaccines will be broadly distributed and things will start to go back to normal. And that day looks to be in 2021 — several different vaccines have been developed that show high rates of effectiveness in creating immunity from COVID-19. The UK has already approved one of the vaccines as part of an expedited emergency review process, and the EU announced that it will decide by Dec. 29 whether to provisionally authorize the vaccine as well.
While the vaccine situation is not ideal (there are some issues with distributing the vaccine and worries about how many will be willing to take it, and Pfizer has reduced the number of doses it will develop because of production issues8), it is very good compared to just a few months ago when medical experts were skeptical that an effective vaccine for a coronavirus could be developed.
Looking toward 2021
And so, as parts of the world experience what is likely to be a very cruel season in the next few months, we need to look ahead. We have the great gift of knowing things are going to get better. Companies may ramp up spending in advance of broad distribution of the vaccine, and even consumers may become more optimistic, especially if adequate fiscal support is provided in the near term.
Given the length of this mean season, I believe there is a tightly coiled spring of pent-up demand, and I expect a sharp rebound as broad vaccine distribution is achieved. Just recall the significant rebound experienced last spring for a series of economies as lockdown measures were rolled back; the distribution of vaccines should cause an even stronger rebound.
Meanwhile, other parts of the world, such as China and South Korea, have managed the pandemic relatively well in recent months and are continuing to experience a solid recovery, with November PMIs higher than October’s. I expect them to lead the recovery in 2021.
In short, I expect this recovery to be very different than the one we saw following the Global Financial Crisis. While that one was anemic, this one is likely to be far more robust. And that’s what we need to keep in mind as we experience this mean season.

Key takeaways
A “no deal” Brexit looms
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned businesses to stockpile inventory in the event of a “crash out” Brexit.
US stimulus hopes wane
It seems the potential for a fiscal stimulus package in the near term is declining by the minute.
US Senate runoff is in play
Party control of the Senate will be decided by these two races — which will in turn shape future stimulus and tax policy.

Weekly Market Compass: I address nine issues to follow over the next few weeks
This is the last blog of the year for me. And what a year it has been — one full of loss. Loss of people, first and foremost, and also of businesses. It was just reported the other day that New York icon The 21 Club will be closing for good, the latest of many service-related businesses to sadly fall victim to the pandemic. I think we are all eagerly waiting to close the books on 2020 and looking forward to brighter days in 2021. I want to thank the many health care workers and other frontline workers (including grocery store employees, emergency responders, and teachers) who have risked their lives this year in the face of the pandemic. I think I speak for all of my Invesco colleagues in saying that I am in awe of you and all you have done this year.
As we close out 2020 and look ahead to 2021, this is what I will be watching in the coming weeks:
1)    Brexit. We still don’t know what will happen, as the most recent deadline has been extended, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned businesses to stockpile inventory in the event of a “crash out” Brexit, and both sides said on Friday that a “no deal” separation was the most likely outcome. The stakes are very high, especially in the midst of a pandemic. I truly hope that an agreement is reached because I don’t believe a “no deal” Brexit is fully priced into markets.
2)    US fiscal stimulus. It seems the potential for a fiscal stimulus package in the near term is declining by the minute. While the proposed $900 billion package is inadequate, in my view, no stimulus at all would cause even more economic scarring, as the Federal Reserve (Fed) has warned.1 I expect more businesses to close in the coming weeks and months, and anticipate that the upcoming US jobs reports will reflect very anemic job growth. This would exacerbate the “K” shape that the recovery has been taking, exacerbating the income and wealth inequality gaps. However, I expect the economic rebound that unfolds in 2021 to be robust and more inclusive than what followed the global financial crisis. So long as financial conditions remain loose, “creative destruction” can occur and new businesses can start up. However, that doesn’t mean there won’t be significant damage created by the lack of adequate fiscal stimulus in the short run.
3)    The Federal Reserve. The Fed meets this week, on the heels of last week’s European Central Bank (ECB) meeting, in which the ECB expanded its asset purchase program — but disappointed many who were hoping for more. I believe the Fed will need to reinforce its support for markets and the economy given the Treasury Department’s decision to claw back the funding of a number of credit facilities. I suspect that support may come in the form of guidance about future quantitative easing purchases being increased and focused on longer-term maturities because the Fed expects economic conditions to worsen in the near term. This could lower longer-term yields, which should be supportive of the economy and markets. The Fed could also reiterate its willingness to be more tolerant of inflation and let the economy run before it raises rates. I believe this means that the US dollar may remain weak relative to other major currencies such as the euro.
4)    The US Senate runoff races in Georgia. Party control of the Senate will be decided by these two races — which will in turn shape future stimulus (including infrastructure and “green” spending) and tax policy in America. While I believe it’s far more likely that one or both seats will be won by Republicans, if both seats go to the Democratic candidates (which I assign a very unscientific probability of about 20% to), then expect stimulus to be larger and include state and local government aid — but taxes are likely to rise as well. This might cause short-term jitters for stocks.
5)    COVID-19 infection rates. US cases continue to rise with no signs of abatement. The eurozone has had some success “bending the curve” of the current wave thus far, but winter is just beginning in the northern hemisphere. Germany just announced a serious lockdown to combat the spread of the virus, which has hit the country hard. If infections in Western developed countries rise enough, that could be very damaging to their economies, and in a worst-case scenario, result in a double-dip recession.
6)    Vaccine hiccups. The UK and the US have both approved use of COVID-19 vaccines, and more countries will soon follow, which is incredibly positive news. However, we need to recognize that if there is difficulty with distribution or side effects for those who have taken the vaccine, that would likely cause downward gyrations for stocks. We also want to follow the percentage of given populations willing to take the vaccine, as that will dictate how quickly we can move past COVID-19 and return to normalcy.
7)    Capital expenditures. As I’ve said before, I expect capex spending to rise in advance of broad distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in many countries. And I expect business sentiment to rise in advance of capex spending, and so I will be following both metrics closely. I wouldn’t be surprised to see sentiment improve in the next month or so despite a difficult environment in terms of infections.
8)    Chinese economic data. The Chinese economy has been performing well given its ability to control the virus, and we expect it to lead the economic recovery in 2021 given this strength. We are already seeing very encouraging economic data. For example, car sales for November in China were strong, rising 11.6% over the previous year.2 However, we will be following economic data closely to confirm continued strength.
9)    Markets. Markets have been on a tear since March. Initial public offerings, which have been the object of great enthusiasm this year, are emblematic of this “risk on” environment. Understandably, clients keep wondering how long markets can continue to look through current problems. I believe it’s normal to experience consolidation after a strong run-up, as we have seen this year. Triggers for a sell-off could include any of the factors listed above, from a substantial rise in COVID-19 infections that suppress economic activity to hiccups for vaccine distribution. I would stress that, given the monetary policy backdrop, I would expect any sell-off to be very short-term in nature as we look ahead to a strong economic recovery driven by the vaccine, which in turn should be positive for corporate earnings. I should add that a sell-off in stocks would probably be accompanied by a rise in gold, but that would be short-lived as well, in my view.
I will be following all of these items closely and will update readers when my article series returns on Jan. 4. I wish you and yours a happy holiday season.

Key takeaways
Digital currency?
Proponents point to bitcoin as “the people’s currency,” but I believe it’s not really a realistic, useable currency.
Digital gold?
Typically, gold is held in a portfolio for diversification purposes, but it’s not clear that bitcoin could offer similar benefits.
Digital tulip?
I believe bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could very well remain popular, but they’re a very risky investment.

Weekly Market Compass: Bitcoin has gained credibility over the past three years, but I believe its use as a currency, a diversifier or an inflation hedge is a bit off the mark.
The last time I wrote about bitcoin was back in December 2017. Back then there was a lot of excitement around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because both the Chicago Board Options Exchange and CME Group had begun offering bitcoin futures. Investors were excited about this opportunity, sending up the price of a single bitcoin thousands of dollars higher over the several previous weeks. In late December 2017, bitcoin hit a peak of more than $19,783 before falling precipitously in the ensuing weeks and months.1 It didn’t again reach that level until December 2020.2 But this time, the bitcoin excitement is a bit different. Today, some institutional investors are starting to dip their toes into cryptocurrencies — or are at least considering it. And last week, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen lent credibility to cryptocurrencies as an investment by recognizing their popularity and assuring that they will be more heavily regulated to ensure investors are protected.
Not surprisingly, I have received a flurry of questions in recent days and weeks about whether bitcoin is suitable for an institutional or retail investor’s portfolio. In particular, clients are wondering if 1) bitcoin can be considered a currency or 2) if bitcoin can be considered a commodity such as gold. Let’s explore both assertions:
Digital currency?
Let’s start with the first question. Proponents of bitcoin point to it as “the people’s currency” because it’s a peer-to-peer system that doesn’t involve any central banks or third-party administrators. In fact, it was launched in early 2009, a swift response to the global financial crisis and the loss of trust in institutions. It’s also touted as being “fraud-proof” in that transactions are recorded in a distributed ledger; in other words, when a transaction occurs, it’s verified and then copied and transmitted to other computers. In an environment in which central banks are pursuing very accommodative monetary policy and are “printing money,” bitcoin investors believe bitcoin is a better store of value than fiat currencies because bitcoin, like gold, has a finite supply and should hold its value better.
However, I believe bitcoin is not really a realistic, useable currency. Transaction speeds for bitcoin are much slower than for financial transactions performed by MasterCard or Visa. Merriam-Webster defines a currency as “something (such as coins, treasury notes, and banknotes) that is in circulation as a medium of exchange.” It’s difficult for bitcoin to be used as a medium of exchange given the dramatic price fluctuations it experiences. After all, why buy a car with bitcoin if the price of bitcoin might go up significantly in the next week?
Digital gold?
I would argue that bitcoin has characteristics that make it less like a currency and more like a commodity, especially gold. Like gold, bitcoin has to be “mined,” a laborious digital process that unleashes blocks on a blockchain. Like gold, bitcoin’s value is dictated by the laws of supply and demand – how much traders are willing to pay for it. The gold supply has increased in recent years an average of 1.2% per year.2  While bitcoin supply is currently increasing about 1.7% per year, that percentage will continue to fall until the year 2140, when no more bitcoin can be mined.3
Some investing pundits are suggesting that gold is falling in price because money that would have been allocated there is now being invested in bitcoin because it serves the same role in one’s portfolio. Others suggest that older investors will continue to invest in gold while younger investors will choose to invest in “digital gold” because it has many of the same investment attributes as gold.
But is that really the case? Bitcoin may be considered a digital commodity, but investors need to compare its potential role in a portfolio versus a traditional commodity like gold. Let’s explore:

Typically, gold is held in a portfolio for diversification purposes. It’s not clear that bitcoin could offer similar diversification benefits given that its correlation with the S&P 500 has been 0.72 in the last year.4 By contrast, gold had a correlation of just 0.38 for the same time period. 4
Some hold gold because it’s viewed as an inflation hedge, and in certain time periods — but not all — it has exhibited some inflation-hedging qualities. However, bitcoin hasn’t been around long enough for there to be a performance record in periods of higher inflation. In other words, investors shouldn’t assume it’s an effective inflation hedge.
Gold is also held in portfolios as a hedge on geopolitical risk. And historically, gold has offered better relative performance than stocks in times of crisis. For example, between the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and the stock market bottom in early March 2009, the price of gold actually rose although it exhibited significant volatility.5 In contrast, as the pandemic spread in February 2020, bitcoin fell along with stocks and rebounded with stocks, exhibiting little in the way of hedging qualities. (I must add that while gold held up in February, it did fall in March until rebounding along with stocks and bitcoin.)
Unlike bitcoin, gold arguably has some intrinsic value in that it is used in electronics and similar goods as well as jewelry. For example, many microchips use gold as a conductor.

Digital tulip?
And so, it appears that price appreciation is the main reason investors want to hold bitcoin in their portfolios. In other words, the “fear of missing out” could very well be the driving force behind bitcoin investing. Yes, bitcoin has exhibited strong price appreciation in recent months. However, investors need to be aware of its longer-term price history. Since 2011, bitcoin has spent 93.6% of days trading beneath its highs versus 86.6% for the S&P 500.6 What’s more, on the days when bitcoin was beneath its highs, it traded an average 53.5% below those highs. 6 On the days when the S&P 500 traded below its highs, it traded an average 3.8% below those highs.6
The price of bitcoin recently has been driven by scarcity of supply and increasing interest in its upward momentum. As more investors note the rising price and buy into this trend, the cycle continues, pushing prices upward. Given that bitcoin is a digital asset with no income streams and poor ability to scale in terms of transactions capacity — and that enormous energy consumption comes with running the bitcoin blockchain — one is left to wonder what pricing dynamics should back bitcoin once buyers stop bidding the price upward.
In short, I believe bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could very well remain popular, but they’re a very risky investment. While bitcoin has gained significant credibility in recent months because of interest from institutional investors, it could still be the digital equivalent of “tulip mania,” which gripped Holland in the 1600s and sent the price of tulip bulbs to astronomical and unsustainable highs before their inevitable crash. Given that bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it’s difficult to predict just how high it may rise or how low it may fall in coming months — although I suspect it will be very volatile. And given its limited track record, it’s difficult to predict if bitcoin could be an effective hedge against risks such as inflation.
In closing, I am keeping all of my friends and colleagues in Texas in my thoughts, and praying for everyone who has suffered from the severe winter weather conditions over the last week.

Key takeaways
Israel leads the world in vaccinations
Israel far surpasses other nations in terms of the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated.
Other countries see progress
The US and UK are among those who have ramped up their vaccination programs.
Anticipation grows for a return to normalcy
In my view, anticipation of this rebound is the driving force behind the quick rise in the 10-year US Treasury yield that made headlines last week.

Weekly Market Compass: As Israel leads the way in COVID-19 vaccinations, events such as concerts and theater performances return after an 11-month ban.
When I was in business school back in the late 1990s, I found that one of the most heavily used — and effective — teaching tools was the case study. Learning from what other companies and industries did or didn’t do was incredibly helpful in gaining understanding and insight.
Right now, I’m gaining understanding and insight from a very different case study: Israel’s success with its COVID-19 vaccine program. But this is not in a business school textbook — this is happening in real time. Specifically, I’m looking to Israel as a case study in effective vaccine rollout and the impact on health and the economy. In my view, Israel is the “gold standard” in this endeavor.
Israel leads the world in vaccinations
Israel far surpasses other nations in terms of the percentage of the population that has been vaccinated. By February, 84% of the elderly population (70 years and older) and slightly less than 50% of the overall population had been inoculated against COVID-19.1 Now that is still short of the herd immunity level, which medical experts estimate is between 56.5% and 81.5% of the population.2 However, COVID-19 infections in Israel are down dramatically.
And so Israel is starting to re-open its economy including hotels, malls, markets, gyms, and museums. Those who have completed the proscribed vaccine regimen (or who have recovered from the virus) are beginning to enjoy a whole new world. Israel is issuing them a “Green Pass” that allows them to attend concerts and other cultural events, which are being held once again following an 11-month ban (while still following precautions such as masks and social distancing).3 For example, last Monday a theater in Jerusalem had already treated its audience to a full dress rehearsal of a Noel Coward play scheduled to open later that week.
Other countries see progress in vaccination efforts
I’m confident we can look to Israel for indications of what to expect when enough of the population of other economies, such as the United States, have been inoculated. I’ll be following the Israeli economy closely in coming weeks, as I expect the re-opening to result in a strong increase in consumer spending — and offer a window into the future for other countries. For example, the UK has made significant progress with its vaccination program, and the British prime minister said last week that he was optimistic that the UK could have a full re-opening in June. Similarly, substantial progress has been made in the US, and the Biden administration expects that everyone who wants to be vaccinated will have access to a vaccine by late summer. This could occur even more quickly now that Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine — which requires only one dose —- was approved by the US Food & Drug Administration this past weekend, with 3 million to 4 million doses ready to ship this week.4
Anticipation grows for a return to normalcy
People talk about their “bucket list” of activities that they want to do before they die, and these lists often include once-in-a-lifetime adventures. Now, I’m hearing people talk about their new bucket lists — things they want to do when the pandemic is over. But in addition to elaborate adventures, they are excited to get back to the activities that made up our daily lives back in 2019: things like theater, concerts, movies, travel, dining out, and even going to the mall — the experiences that add richness and variety to everyday life.
Another helpful indication of what the future may hold can be found in the UK. As I mentioned earlier, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last Monday a “road map” for reopening the UK economy in the coming months. In particular, he shared that international trips could resume as early as May 17. It proved to be a clarion call for UK consumers to make travel plans — immediately. Several different European airlines saw a major increase in flight bookings; Tui, the largest travel company in the world, experienced a 500% increase in bookings overnight following Johnson’s announcement. Virgin Atlantic Airways also experienced a major increase in online ticket sales that day, while European economy airline Easy Jet reported that airline ticket sales rose 337% and holiday package bookings rose 630% in the hours after Johnson’s announcement.5 EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren explained that there is clearly “pent up demand for travel.”6 That might be a bit of an understatement.
Consumer spending: a ‘tightly coiled spring’
At the expense of sounding like a broken record, I think of consumer spending as a tightly coiled spring; there is great pent up demand to spend, and the wherewithal to spend, given the elevated household savings rate in the US and other countries. In the US, consumer savings is at 20.5% as of January 2021.7 US personal savings nearly doubled as a result of the pandemic, rising from $1.2 trillion at the end of 2019 to $2.3 trillion at the end of 2020.8 Other countries have experienced a similar phenomenon in terms of very elevated savings. Imagine the strength of the economic recovery if consumers spend just a portion of their savings once the economy re-opens. And I think they will after suffering from a massive case of cabin fever for what is going on a year now.
In my view, anticipation of this strong rebound is the driving force behind the quick rise in the 10-year US Treasury yield that made headlines last week. As I’ve said before, multiple factors impact the yield on the 10-year Treasury — not just inflation. In fact, in my opinion, the most important factor right now is the very bright future of economic re-openings that we are just starting to see unfold in Israel. That does not justify the stock market sell-off we saw last week. It’s almost as if stock market investors forgot that a steepening yield curve is considered a positive indicator. Rather than fear an elevated yield on the 10-year US Treasury, I believe investors should assume it will occur and that it could come with significant volatility. However, it should be positive for cyclical and smaller-cap stocks, which I expect are likely to perform well in such an economic recovery.

Key takeaways
US infrastructure is aging
The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the US needs to spend at least $6.1 trillion on infrastructure over the next decade.
The Biden administration may prioritize infrastructure
During the campaign, the Biden team unveiled its ambitious Build Back Better plan, which included $2 trillion for infrastructure.
We believe now may be different
Other administrations have touted infrastructure, but there are several reasons why we believe the Biden administration may make more progress.

There are several reasons why investors might favor exposure to infrastructure in the current market environment. The asset class offers the potential for attractive returns, an inflation hedge, diversification, and yield.1 Now that the Biden administration has assumed office, we can add one more reason to that list — the potential for increased public spending on infrastructure.
An essential — but aging — asset class
Infrastructure companies own and operate long-lived, high-value physical assets that provide essential services which are critical for the efficient functioning of society. Over the last two decades, global listed infrastructure , measured by the Dow Jones Brookfield Global Infrastructure Index, has delivered approximately 82% of the upside in rising global equity markets and 62% of the downside in falling markets, a level of asymmetry that is appealing to many investors.2
Looking beyond the pandemic, we believe the asset class could benefit from a step-change in infrastructure spending globally. More immediately, however, we think the Biden administration could potentially push ahead with a program that blends much needed upgrades to aging US infrastructure with numerous steps toward climate mitigation and green job creation, all of which could create some interesting opportunities for investors.3
Potential driver of growth and jobs
Government spending on infrastructure historically has been one of the most efficient ways to drive economic growth and create jobs. The Federal Reserve and Congressional Budget Office have attempted to quantify the multiplier effect of capital investment in infrastructure, estimating that every dollar spent generates an economic return of between $1.50 and $2.50.4 Not surprisingly, infrastructure spending was a major component of many government stimulus plans created to address the global financial crisis in 2008.
Despite the dramatic increase in unemployment and the millions of jobs lost due to the pandemic, public investment in US infrastructure still languishes near an all-time low as a share of gross domestic product at about 1.3%, down from its high of about 2.5% in the late 1960s.5 We believe the Biden administration may seek to change this.
Build back even better
During the campaign, the Biden team unveiled its ambitious Build Back Better plan, which included $2 trillion for infrastructure focused primarily on renewable energy, transportation, broadband access, and upgrades for millions of existing buildings.6 Since the Democrats hold a slight edge in the Senate, political analysts now believe the Biden administration may try to push its infrastructure, climate, and job creation efforts even further. This could include additional goals like a 100% carbon-free electric sector by 2035, construction of energy-efficient housing, procuring electric vehicles for the federal fleet, accelerating clean energy/transmission projects, and doubling offshore wind energy by 2030.7 The cost of these plans is expected to be offset, at least in part, by tax increases on corporations and wealthy individuals.8
Previews of coming attractions?
Skeptics may say that we have been here before, with prior administrations having promised major spending on infrastructure that ultimately never came to pass — and they would be right. (The Trump administration had its own $1 trillion infrastructure plan that never got off the shelf.) Yet there are several reasons why we believe the Biden administration and its infrastructure-encompassing Build Back Better plan may make more progress. For example:

Democrats in the House are increasingly discussing reducing the restrictions on Congressional earmarks, the process by which Congress directs funding to specific projects rather than delegating the decision to an executive agency.9 Of course, earmarks have been perceived to inflate the cost of legislation — they have been blamed for wasteful spending and increasingly became a source of scandal, which led to curbs in 2007 and an outright prohibition in 2011.9 Reinstating a limited ability for Congress to direct funding for specific programs could help grease the skids on future infrastructure spending.9
Senator Tom Carper (D-DE) now heads the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the highway bill and would play a key role in infrastructure projects. Carper is seen as less frugal than the committee’s previous head, Senator John Barrasso (R-WY).9
Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg recently made clear that one of his top priorities is to carry out the administration’s ambitious agenda to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure.10

This combination of factors suggests to us that the Biden administration may be quite serious about addressing infrastructure.  
What needs to be fixed
In addition to the new administration’s list of priorities, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that the US needs to spend at least $6.1 trillion on infrastructure over the next decade and at least $12.9 trillion through 2039 (see Exhibit 1). The top priorities include roads, rails, bridges, water systems, the power grid, and airports, among other things.

Executive orders are a bit more complicated. 



When discussing the tools at a president’s disposal, former President Barack Obama famously said, “I’ve got a pen, and I’ve got a phone,” alluding to his powers to drive change with zero or minimal involvement from Congress. President Joe Biden has been in office for less than a month and it’s clear he learned something in his old gig: that whole “pen and a phone” concept is more complicated than it sounds, leaving the president with four tools to force action. In this article, we examine:

How a “regulatory freeze” effectively stops all 11th-hour actions by the outgoing administration
The benefits and drawbacks of Executive Orders
Why a vote in Congress can kill recent rulemaking with a simple majority vote via a Congressional Review Act

Key takeaways
Stocks experienced a sell-off
We saw a rather dramatic sell-off in stocks last week as they adjusted to a rise in rates.
I believe it’s a temporary adjustment
I think of it as a short period of indigestion as stocks get acclimated to higher rates.
Good economic news has continued
I’m even more encouraged about the near-term future for the global economy, thanks to vaccine news, stimulus prospects and more.

Weekly Market Compass: Stocks were hit last week in the face of inflation fears, but I believe it was a temporary adjustment to a rise in rates.
Last week was what I would call a “Rip Van Winkle” week. Set in the colonial days of America, Rip Van Winkle is the story of a man who, sick of his wife, decides to go for a hike in the mountains with his dog. He meets a group of strange men who offer him an unusual drink, causing him to fall asleep. When he wakes up, he realizes that more than 20 years have passed, and that he slept through a tumultuous time: He missed the Revolutionary War, in which many of his friends were killed.
Why was I thinking about this story last week? If investors could have taken an extended nap at the beginning of last week, they would have woken up on Friday night with the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average actually posting a gain — and they would have slept through some major volatility in between, including a significant sell-off.
Some fear that the Fed will be forced to raise rates
Last week was a very difficult period for investors, full of anxiety and fear that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be forced to raise rates because of rising inflation, and that view led to the rise in the 10-year US Treasury yield. There is concern that the Fed may be losing control of interest rates on the long end of the yield curve.
This should come as no surprise, however — the reality is that it’s very difficult for a central bank to control the long end of the curve. While the Fed can try to reassure investors that it won’t raise the federal funds rate, markets can still have doubts, and that’s what we saw last week. The sell-off was exacerbated by the interview with Fed Chair Jay Powell last Thursday. Some market participants expected Powell to announce that the Fed would use yield curve control tools such as “Operation Twist” to control rates on the long end. However, that did not come to fruition and market participants registered their disappointment.
Stocks were hit by a mid-week sell-off
The problem is that when there is a significant rise in the 10-year yield — especially quickly — it can often cause a re-rating of stocks. And that’s exactly what happened last week, when we saw a rather dramatic sell-off in stocks over several days. This is what we should expect when economic growth prospects improve, raising concerns about inflation as well. Rates were adjusting to improving economic growth prospects, and stocks were simply adjusting to the rise in rates. While adjustments can be difficult in all facets of life, not the least of which is markets, an adjustment signifies a transition — it is temporary by nature. I think of it as a short period of indigestion as stocks get acclimated to higher rates.
We saw the mirror image of this last year at this time. Last February and March, we also saw a significant and rapid adjustment in markets — but to deteriorating economic prospects. In early February 2020, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was 1.65%.1 However, as COVID-19 spread and the economic outlook dimmed substantially, the yield on the 10-year adjusted to the new economic reality, plummeting to 0.54% on March 9, 2020.2 The S&P 500 Index, also adjusting to the new economic reality and its potential impact on earnings, closely followed that drop, beginning its plunge in mid-February and only bottoming later in March when the Fed intervened.
The good news is that we are only back to levels where we were before the pandemic. And if we look at past periods of rising 10-year US Treasury yields, we generally see increases in stocks during the same period. That’s what we’ve historically seen when rising yields are fueled by accelerating economic growth and improving corporate earnings (not significant inflation). But at the same time, there can often be a rotation in leadership.  
If we look at Wednesday’s sell-off, two of the most cyclically sensitive sectors posted gains and drove the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average to end the week higher: energy and financials. In fact, in the last month, the S&P 500 Index’s performance has been disappointing, but energy and financials have posted double-digit gains. Again, this is to be expected given the magnitude of the potential recovery. Those sectors that are most cyclically sensitive should be expected to outperform. Typically smaller-cap stocks outperform larger-cap stocks. In other words, I believe this is not a time to abandon stocks, but to understand which sectors and areas of the market could be poised to benefit. There is a lot of disruption going on in various areas — so it is definitely a place for active management, in my view.
We’ve continued to see good economic news
Since writing last week’s blog, I’m even more encouraged about the near-term future for the global economy.

In the US, the Biden administration announced it was moving up its timeline for vaccinations — it now anticipates having enough doses to vaccinate all American adults by the middle of May.  
US real gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasts continue to be revised upward and could be as high as 8% to 10% this year given the likelihood that the new stimulus package gets passed.
China set a 2021 GDP growth target of more than 6% with expectations of creating 11 million new jobs this year.3 There were expectations that China might choose not to release a target, as it did for 2020. But China clearly feels confident enough about its economy to release this forecast — which, by the way, is well below consensus expectations of approximately 8% GDP growth for 2020.4
I’ve been talking a lot about my expectation that there will be a big surge in consumer spending given pent-up demand and elevated household savings in a number of countries. However, I believe a substantial rise in capex spending is also very likely, given the certainty created by COVID-19 vaccines.

Also, I think it’s important to stress two things:

I don’t expect inflation to become “problematic,” to quote Fed Chair Jay Powell. Yes, there could be an increase in inflation as the economy re-opens, but I expect it to be very transitory. There are a number of reasons to believe inflation will be benign, including that there is significant labor market slack that will take time to improve, and that there are longer-term structural forces that will continue to exert downward pressure on inflation, including demographics and technological innovation.
I think it’s likely that the Fed will act if the yield on the 10-year US Treasury rises rapidly from here and creates disorderly markets. Last June, the Fed considered monetary policy tools that could accomplish yield curve control but decided such action was not needed in the current environment. However, the minutes from that July meeting leave the door open to future use if the environment merits it: “… many participants judged that yield caps and targets were not warranted in the current environment but should remain an option that the Committee could reassess in the future if circumstances changed markedly. A couple of participants remarked on the value of yield caps and targets as a means of reinforcing forward guidance on asset purchases, thereby providing insurance against adverse movements in market expectations regarding the path of monetary policy, and as a tool that could help limit the amount of asset purchases that the Committee would need to make in pursuing its dual-mandate goals.”5

Conclusion
In periods like these — when the market is fearful in the near-term, but economic trends look positive — I believe it’s time to look for buying opportunities. Understanding what’s driving the current volatility, and how similar historical periods played out, can help investors decide where to look.

Key takeaways
Markets crave certainty
The good news is that we have gained much greater certainty on a number of topics, including the US presidential election.
A “crash-out” Brexit looks unlikely
EU ambassadors are slated to meet on Nov. 18, and I am optimistic a deal might be arrived at then.
Progress continues toward a vaccine
There has been meaningful progress toward developing a COVID-19 vaccine that could be distributed next year.

Weekly Market Compass: Investors gain clarity on a COVID-19 vaccine, the presidential election, Brexit negotiations, and more
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell once said, “What men want is not knowledge but certainty.” I have been thinking a lot about that quote in the last several weeks, and how especially in such uncertain times, certainty may be more helpful than knowledge in allowing us to move forward.
Markets crave certainty as much as humans, and the good news is that we have gained much greater certainty on a number of topics than we had just a few weeks ago:
1)    COVID-19 vaccine. There has been meaningful progress toward developing a vaccine that could be distributed next year. Pfizer announced last week that it has developed a vaccine that has produced strong results in trials thus far, indicating it is 90% effective. And today (Nov. 16), Moderna announced that its coronavirus vaccine was 94.5% effective, based on early results from its ongoing study. While we are many steps away from broad distribution, this is truly a game-changing development, and would represent the most important certainty of all. I expect a vaccine to be widely distributed at some point next year, which should begin the return to normalcy that the world has craved since early 2020.
2)    Presidential politics. There is a winner in the US presidential election. Perhaps the greatest fear investors had going into November was that there would be a contested election that would plunge the US into chaos. While there have been some lawsuits in specific states regarding the validity of some votes, I believe they are extremely unlikely to change the outcome. This eliminates a huge amount of uncertainty.
3)    Brexit. A “crash out” Brexit looks increasingly unlikely. Significant progress has been made in negotiations recently, and further negotiations will likely be helped by pressure from the incoming Biden administration and the surprise resignation of Dominic Cummings. He was the most vociferous Brexiteer, and his departure enables UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is not an ideologue, to take a less hard-line approach to negotiations. EU ambassadors are slated to meet on Nov. 18, and I am optimistic a deal might be arrived at then.
4)    Taxes. The odds of a tax hike in the US next year are very slim. Many companies feared that their tax situation would become less favorable under a Biden administration. After all, on the campaign trail, Joe Biden made no secret of the fact that he wanted to raise taxes in a number of areas — corporate taxes, income taxes on households earning $400,000 or more, and capital gains tax rates on households earning over $1 million — in order to fund his ambitious spending plans. However, it seems very unlikely that he will be able to accomplish this goal given that the Senate is most likely to remain Republican and would therefore have the votes to block any tax increase. This is good news 1) for investors, in my view — I believe the second greatest fear investors had going into November (after a contested election) was that there would be a “blue wave” that would result in higher taxes.
5)    US foreign policy. I expect US foreign policy, including trade policy, to return to a more traditional approach next year. President-elect Biden has stated his intentions for the US to re-enter the Paris Climate Accord and to re-join the World Health Organization. Most importantly, I expect dramatic changes in trade policy. Biden is not a proponent of tariffs, and I believe that his approach to trade disputes will be more surgical — focusing on specific trade issues and negotiating with China over them, rather than applying broad tariffs. This should create greater predictability.
Uncertainty still clouds some issues
Now that doesn’t mean we’ve eliminated all uncertainty. One great source of uncertainty is COVID-19 infections, which have risen rapidly in the eurozone, the US, and some parts of the emerging markets. The eurozone appears to be flattening the curve in recent days, although it is too early to tell if this is sustainable. And it’s uncertain whether the US will be able to get control of this wave of the virus — although it seems likely the situation will get far worse before it gets better — and it’s uncertain how government leaders and individuals will react. As Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell explained last week, “We have got new cases at a record level, we have seen a number of states begin to reimpose limited activity restrictions, and people may lose confidence that it is safe to go out.”1 However, this should be cushioned by the knowledge that there is a light at the end of the tunnel — the vaccine.
Another source of uncertainty is US fiscal stimulus. While President Donald Trump called for a big fiscal stimulus package this weekend, it is unlikely we will get a significant one before the end of the year, especially since the White House has largely withdrawn from negotiations, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was an important force in bringing the last several stimulus packages to fruition. I do believe there is a good chance that President-elect Biden may be able to arrive at a fiscal stimulus package if he can win over several moderate Republicans, but I would only expect it to be about $1.5 trillion in size (in comparison, the CARES Act passed earlier this year was $2.2 trillion).
But, all in all, we have a lot more certainty and clarity going forward. So what does greater certainty mean for the economy? It means greater confidence from both businesses and consumers. That in turn can mean higher capex spending by businesses because there is more visibility about the future. It gives hope even as COVID-19 cases rise.
And what does greater certainty mean for markets? It also gives hope even as COVID-19 cases rise. It means stocks could soon start discounting this clearer future. In short, I believe it means quite a bit.

Midstream equities outperformed the broader markets in February
Fourth-quarter financial results were up from the prior quarter and better than market participants expected.
Focus turns to Biden’s Federal Lands oil and gas review
President Joe Biden’s Executive Order is not expected to have a meaningful near-term impact on midstream cash flows.

Midstream equities outperformed the broader markets in February as fourth-quarter financial results were better than consensus expectations and up from the prior quarter. President Joe Biden’s Federal Lands oil and gas review is not expected to have a meaningful near-term impact on midstream cash flows.
MLP market overview

Midstream MLPs, as measured by the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), ended February up 6.3% on a price basis and up 7.8% after distributions are considered. The AMZ outperformed the S&P 500 Index’s 2.8% total return for the month. The best-performing midstream subsector for February was the Compression group, while the Propane subsector underperformed, on average.
For the year through February, the AMZ is up 11.4% on a price basis, resulting in a 14.0% total return. This compares to the S&P 500 Index’s 1.5% and 1.7% price and total returns, respectively. The Compression group has produced the best average total return year-to-date, while the Natural Gas Pipeline subsector has lagged.

MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-Year US Treasury Bond, narrowed by 97 basis points (bps) over the month, exiting the period at 794 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 692 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 424 bps. The AMZ indicated distribution yield at month-end was 9.4%.

Midstream MLPs and affiliates raised no new marketed equity (common or preferred, excluding at-the-market programs) and $3.2 billion of debt during the month. No new asset acquisitions were announced in February.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil exited the month at $61.50 per barrel, up 17.8% over the period and 37.4% higher year-over-year. Natural gas prices ended February at $2.77 per million British thermal units (MMbtu), up 8.1% over the month and 64.5% higher than February 2020. Natural gas liquids (NGL) pricing at Mont Belvieu exited the month at $32.25 per barrel, 7.4% higher than the end of January and 89.8% higher than the year-ago period.

News

Fourth-quarter earnings season nears an end. Fourth-quarter reporting season was nearing completion as March began. Through month-end, 53 midstream entities had announced distributions for the quarter, including seven distribution increases, one reduction, and 44 distributions that were unchanged from the previous quarter. Through the end of February, 46 sector participants had reported fourth-quarter financial results. Operating performance has been, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA (or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), coming in 2.1% higher than consensus estimates from market participants and 8.3% higher than the preceding quarter.

We’re watching recent M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity. Several mergers or acquisitions materialized during the month of February. Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) announced an agreement to acquire Enable Midstream Partners (NYSE: ENBL) in an all-equity transaction valued at approximately $7.2 billion. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) offered to acquire Noble Midstream Partners (NYSE: NBLX) at $12.47 per unit, with the offer now being reviewed by NBLX’s Board of Directors. GasLog Ltd (NYSE: GLOG) entered an agreement to be acquired by BlackRock’s Global Energy & Power Infrastructure team. Additionally, Navios Maritime Partners (NYSE: NMM) announced an agreement to acquire Navios Maritime Containers (NYSE: NMCI). And finally, TC Energy’s (NYSE: TRP) acquisition of TC Pipelines (NYSE: TCP) was approved by TCP unitholders and New Fortress Energy’s (NYSE: NFE) purchase of Golar LNG Partners (NYSE: GMLP) was approved by GMLP unitholders.

EnLink employs crafty capital avoidance strategy. EnLink Midstream (NYSE: ENLC) noted that it will move a natural gas processing plant from Oklahoma toTexas. The Battle Ridge processing facility will be moved from an out-of-favor region in Oklahoma to the Permian Basin in Texas, where ENLC’s existing system has experienced robust growth and is nearing its operating capacity. The relocation strategy is expected to save ENLC approximately $55 million compared to building a new plant in the Permian.

Chart of the month: Midstream production mostly occurs on private lands
In January President Biden issued an Executive Order that included a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands while a comprehensive review of oil and gas permitting and leasing is conducted. In our opinion, we do not expect this review to have a significant impact on near-term producer activity, as producers typically carry years of permits. From a midstream perspective, activities on federal lands represent only a small portion of cash flows, accounting for an estimated 3.5% of EBITDA, as most oil and gas activity occurs on private lands.

Key takeaways
People are primed to spend
There is no lack of confidence — businesses and households are just waiting for the mass distribution of vaccines to spend.
And overall, they have the money to do it
US household net worth grew during the pandemic, meaning that many Americans have available money to spend when the economy fully re-opens.
My view is highly optimistic
There are risks to this very positive economic outlook, but I believe they are relatively low.

Weekly Market Compass: Seven reasons I expect a powerful US economic recovery in 2021. 
I periodically walk into stores to get a sense of how the US economy is doing. This past weekend I walked into a car dealership in my area. I chatted with a car salesman who has worked in the industry for more than 50 years. He shared that this is a very strange economic environment — car purchases have increased (he had already sold four cars that day), but so have the number of people stopping by to see if there are any job openings, who say they’ve been out of work for six or nine months. This is emblematic of the “K-shaped” recovery we’re in — some have seen their financial fortunes improve during the pandemic while others have seen their financial situation deteriorate. However, I will reiterate what I’ve said before: I’m extremely positive about the US economic recovery. I believe it will be far more robust and inclusive than recent recoveries. Here are the reasons:
1. The nature of the crisis and the solution
In past crises, especially the global financial crisis, the recovery depended on slowly building confidence over time, in order to induce companies and households to spend. This crisis is very different. The economic shutdown was forced upon people, many of whom are looking forward to being able to spend again as economies open up. We’re not seeing the lack of confidence that we typically see in recessions — businesses and households are just waiting for the mass distribution of vaccines, which I believe will provide the only confidence needed for the economic recovery to accelerate significantly.
2. Vaccine progress
The distribution of vaccines in the US has been impressive. In just the last week, the Biden administration has moved up the timeline twice on when all American adults can expect to be eligible to be vaccinated. This suggests the US could reach herd immunity this summer.
3. Elevated household savings
Last week, the Federal Reserve reported that household net worth as of year-end 2020 was more than $130 trillion — $12 trillion more than it was in 2019.1 In other words, household net worth grew 10% during the pandemic as many Americans — the upper leg of the K-shaped recovery — saw their financial prospects improve during the crisis. This means they have available money to spend when the US economy fully re-opens.
4. A fresh round of stimulus
Last week also saw the most recent US stimulus package signed into law. This should be a positive for many Americans on the lower leg of the K-shaped recovery — in other words, those most negatively impacted by the pandemic. This $1.9 trillion stimulus package should also help make the economic rebound in the back half of 2021 more robust.
5. A strong jobs recovery
The stimulus package is a short-term fix; those on the lower leg of the K-shaped recovery will need jobs for the recovery to be sustainable. It seems that companies have already begun to hire in advance of a broad re-opening of the economy; as we saw in the February employment situation report, non-farm payrolls grew by 379,000, with most of the hiring coming from areas hard hit by the pandemic, such as travel and leisure.2  And it seems companies plan to hire more. The National Federation of Independent Business’s monthly jobs report for February indicates a net 18% of small business owners are planning to create new jobs in the next three months.3
6. Positive consumer sentiment
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index preliminary reading for March rose to 83, the highest level it has been at since the pandemic began.4 According to Surveys of Consumers Chief Economist Richard Curtin, ""consumer sentiment rose in early March to its highest level in a year due to the growing number of vaccinations as well as the widely anticipated passage of Biden's relief measures…"". Consumer expectations in particular rose substantially, suggesting excitement over the re-opening of the economy.
7. Pent-up demand
I know I have said it before, but it bears repeating — there’s a lot of money waiting to be spent. Anyone who has been in New York City during Fleet Week knows what pent-up demand looks like — sailors enjoying all that New York City has to offer after a long time on a boat. Well, what we have now with the pandemic is pent-up demand on steroids. A long-time friend is a financial professional, and she recently shared that every day she has conversations with her high-net-worth clients where they tell her they have stockpiled a lot of cash and are waiting eagerly to be vaccinated so they can start enjoying life again — going to a restaurant, shopping in a mall, getting on a plane. I suspect this spending spree may go on throughout the back half of 2021, if not longer.
The ingredients of a strong recovery
In short, all the ingredients of a strong recovery are present — Americans are ready, willing, and able to spend. Now, there are risks to this very positive economic outlook, but I believe they are relatively low. A surge in COVID-19 infections could delay the re-opening of the economy for a while, and the development of mutations that are not protected against by current vaccines could derail the recovery altogether.
Can the stock rally continue?
We’ve already seen a strong rally in US stocks since the lows of the pandemic. So why am I so positive on them? Simply put, I believe they still have legs.

As of March 12, the year-over-year earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 Index is expected to be 22.1%, up from an estimated 15.5% on Dec. 31.5 If the current estimate comes to fruition, it would be the largest increase in earnings growth since the third quarter of 2018. For calendar year 2021, earnings growth for the S&P 500 Index is expected to be 24.3%, up from 22.6% on Dec. 31, 2020.5
The Fed remains committed to accommodation. Fed Chair Jay Powell and other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have reiterated that they will remain “patiently accommodative” and will be predisposed to view any significant rise in inflation as “transitory,” and therefore will not tighten this year. I look forward to the FOMC meeting this week, where I expect Powell to reiterate his reassurances that there will be no tightening in 2021.

There are certainly risks to my positive outlook on the US stock market: specifically valuations and long rates.
Yes, valuations for the S&P 500 Index are higher than their historical average. Specifically, the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.9 is higher than the 5-year average of 17.7 and the 10-year average of 15.8.5 However, it is below its year-end 2020 level of 22.5.5 And in 2021, earnings expectations have been outpacing the rise in stock prices. It’s important to note that since year end, the S&P 500 Index (price index) has increased by 4.9%, while the forward 12-month earnings per share estimate has increased by 7.7%.5 It’s also worth noting that valuations have rarely been predictive of performance in the near term.
In terms of the 10-year US Treasury yield, there’s always a good chance it could move higher in such a strong economy. Some have argued that if it hits the 2% level, it would cause problems for stocks. A 2% yield is certainly possible in what I expect to be a strong economy, but I think that would only create a very short-term headwind for stocks as they digest the change. And, as I have said before, there is also the possibility of Fed intervention to lower long-term interest rates. Just last week the European Central Bank announced that it would increase asset purchases, although it is not technically yield curve control. Perhaps we will hear more about the potential for yield curve control or some form of Operation Twist in the US from Fed Chair Powell at this week’s FOMC meeting press conference.
Conclusion
This level of optimism isn’t a place I arrived at lightly. It’s a view that was enabled by a massive scientific and logistical endeavor to develop and deliver a COVID-19 vaccine, a political push to provide multiple rounds of stimulus, and a central bank commitment to remain patient and accommodative. Since the beginning of the crisis, I’ve advocated for a multi-pronged approach to combating the crisis, and I believe we’re about to see the benefits.

Aggressive macro and fiscal policies and a vaccine rollout that potentially paves the way for normalized economic activity have renewed the market’s focus on inflation. Although base effects are likely to push up inflation in the first half of 2021, we expect inflation to remain well contained in the medium term due to excess capacity in the service sector and the residual impacts of COVID-19. We lay out our near- and longer-term views on inflation below.
Near-term outlook for inflation
US inflation plummeted in response to the sharp demand contraction due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Inflation has begun to recover, but on a year-over-year basis, remains depressed versus before the COVID-19 shutdown. This is likely to change in 2021 as the period of the shutdown recedes, and the base effects lead to a year-over-year pickup in measured inflation in Q2 2021. Measured core inflation should equal or surpass the level before the shutdown by mid-year 2021. This just represents the impact of the shutdown washing through and the economy returning to an inflationary trend. Inflation breakevens, measured by the US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market, are indicating exactly this dynamic, having returned to the levels that prevailed before the shutdown.
Medium-term outlook for inflation
US inflation in the medium term will likely be driven by the confluence of two different factors. The first factor is the extraordinary amount of monetary stimulus that has been put into the US economy, which has led to sharp growth in lending and monetary aggregates. The sharp growth in money supply should put upward pressure on prices in the coming two or three years. The exact amount of upward pressure is hard to calibrate, but we have not seen growth in monetary aggregates like the current situation in many years. This argues for inflation two to three years out breaking above the levels that have prevailed in recent years. This might allow US consumer price inflation to achieve levels above 2.5%. This is why Invesco Fixed Income favors yield curve steepeners and long inflation breakeven trades.

Key takeaways
The pandemic has caused an unprecedented split in the economy
The Leisure and Entertainment sector could offer investors a unique way to play the re-opening.
Traditional sector investing drives investors toward beneficiaries of the “stay home” economy
A more targeted industry approach could provide more nuance.
Diligent rebalancing and a smart beta process could keep strategies nimble
Staying focused on fundamentals and rebalancing regularly could provide flexibility in a rapidly changing economy.

Since the global pandemic took hold in 2020, economies around the world have been on a rollercoaster ride. Even with unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, the recovery has been extremely uneven. While some companies thrived in the “stay home” economy, many more have struggled with quarantine orders and nervous customers. Now, as the US moves toward vaccinations and begins the process of re-opening, investors are looking for creative ways to invest in these companies that have long awaited the resumption of the “go out” economy. Below, I explain why taking a focused, industry-level approach in the Leisure and Entertainment space could help investors leverage this unique opportunity.

The pandemic has caused an unprecedented split in the economy
 Early in the pandemic, there was a concerted effort to determine the shape that the eventual economic recovery would take. Would we see a V-shape with a sharp upswing after the lockdowns of spring 2020? Would we see a long-tailed U-shape with slow, stalling growth? What we ended up seeing was far more divergent — what many now describe as the “K-shaped recovery” — with e-commerce companies that became staples for pandemic shopping regaining their footing quickly while laggards have struggled for longer.

Nowhere has this been clearer than in the “go out” economy. Restaurants, stores, entertainment facilities — all have struggled with a lack of customers and far higher costs of safely doing business. Job losses have been concentrated among lower wage workers, and policymakers are deeply concerned about the scarring effects this divergence will have on the economy.
However, there now appears to be light at the end of the tunnel. At the time of writing, the US is now more than 10% vaccinated while acquired immunity through infections is speculated to put US immunity far higher. Even before herd immunity is reached, cases have recently fallen as much as 60%, potentially pulling at least some of the re-opening into spring.1 This has driven investors to speculate about how to invest as the economy rotates back into something far more familiar. Through unprecedented economic stimulus, consumers also have large reserves of cash on hand, and they will likely be eager to spend it when they can finally venture safely out of their homes.

While many investors are focusing on traditional sources of value— financials, energy stocks, and more — I propose looking at Leisure and Entertainment as a potential source of value in these unprecedented times. The Invesco Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment ETF (PEJ) may provide a potential solution for investors interested in this segment of the economy.

Traditional sector investing drives investors toward e-commerce giants

When investors think about the opportunity presented by the full reemergence of the American consumer, they naturally think of traditional sector investing such as the Consumer Discretionary sector. However, given the divergence in the economy, more nuance may be required. For example, the SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF (XLY) held 22.48% of the portfolio in Amazon at the end of January.2 While Amazon is certainly consumer-oriented, it has been one of the largest beneficiaries of the “stay home” economy.

By taking a more nuanced industry approach, investors could potentially target their desired exposure. In the case of PEJ, the fund tracks the Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment Intellidex index, which focuses squarely on the externally facing consumer. Screening companies through bottom-up revenue data, the index universe ranges from hospitality to entertainment programming, investing in companies such as hotels, restaurants, cruises and airlines, media companies, theme parks, and movie theaters. While media has offered some safe havens during the pandemic, many conglomerates like Disney also stand to benefit from the full re-opening of parks and retail stores.3 In fact, through segment revenue analysis, we found that PEJ was 61% exposed to in-person activities as of its last rebalance.4

Diligent rebalancing and a smart beta process could keep strategies nimble
The Intellidex index series follows a smart beta strategy, focused on fundamentals within each respective industry. By tracking 47 distinct indicators, the index targets five broader factors —price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value. Perhaps more importantly, this quantitative model is reapplied quarterly, which may provide the flexibility investors need in a quickly developing economic environment.

The chart below shows the industry exposure of PEJ quarterly over the last five years. Even within a focused industry such as Leisure & Entertainment, there is a wide array of business lines whose relative weights can shift dramatically over time. Take the airline industry, for example, which has been in the fund 83% of the time over the last five years. During the pandemic, however, the fund made a noticeable shift away from airlines and hotels and into entertainment and media. Because of the diligent rebalance process, different segments can come to the forefront as fundamentals wax and wane.
More importantly, this flexibility could help investors stay nimble as new phases of re-opening occur, as it is entirely possible that we will see a staged recovery. Beginning with their favorite restaurants and bars, consumers will likely be eager to revisit local establishments before they can plan longer trips from home that involve planes, hotels, and cruise ships. By using a smart beta process, investors can rely on the fundamentals to eventually rotate into these areas instead of attempting to time bets within the industry.

For example, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey dramatically exceeded expectations, clocking in at 51.8 vs 23.3 expected.1 Nearly 70% of the firms surveyed expect increases in activity over the next six months (only 55% expected such increases last month), while 8% expect declines — which is an improvement over last month’s 15% who expected declines.1 I believe that business optimism will persist throughout the year as economic conditions continue to improve.
The Federal Reserve remains dovish
The Fed was very dovish in the “dot plots” released last week. Growth projections were revised upward and unemployment projections were revised downward — but there was no material change in expectations for the fed funds rate. The Fed really meant it when it said it changed its policy framework, and average inflation targeting has important implications. Specifically, the Fed has abandoned pre-emptive tightening. As Fed Chair Jay Powell underscored, the “fundamental change in our framework means we’re not going to act preemptively based on forecasts, for the most part. We’re going to wait and see actual data.”2
I believe we will continue to see this Fed dovishness on display throughout the year, with Powell insisting that any increase in inflation is transitory, and then actually treating any increase in inflation as transitory. In my view, the Fed will not tighten this year, allowing the economy to accelerate.
Investors fear inflation
Of course, the Fed again spurred investor fears of inflation last week because of its dovishness. I think these investor concerns will persist periodically throughout the year, given what I expect to be a strong economic rebound — and continued Fed dovishness. While I think it’s very possible that we get a short-term increase in inflation on a surge in spending as the economy re-opens, I don’t believe we will see a longer-term increase in inflation. There are powerful forces at work that are likely to keep a lid on longer-term inflation — namely demographics and innovation.
Rising 10-year Treasury yield pose a headwind for stocks
Treasuries sold off last week on this fear of inflation. Adding to the rise in yields was the Fed’s announcement on Friday that it would be discontinuing the relaxation of the supplementary leverage ratio rules, which means banks will no longer be able to exclude Treasuries and deposits in the calculation of their respective leverage ratios. Re-imposing that requirement is expected to result in banks selling Treasuries.
The rising yield on the 10-year US Treasury created headwinds for stocks last week — not just in the US but in Europe and Asia as well. I believe we will continue to see this throughout the year. However, I must reiterate that I believe the stock headwinds created by rising yields are only temporary, as stocks digest higher rates.
Talk of a tax increase heats up
Last week saw a focus on the possibility of tax increases in the United States. There’s continued chatter about hiking corporate taxes. An official in the Biden administration shared that the administration wants to raise taxes on any households earning $400,000 or more. This seemed to contradict a campaign promise that the Biden administration would not hike taxes on individuals earning less than $400,000. Also this month, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed a tax on ultra-wealthy Americans.
I suspect there will be many more conversations about tax hikes in the US — and elsewhere — given all that needs to be paid for given the pandemic and severe economic downturn of the past year. However, I continue to believe it will be difficult for the Biden administration to actually get much in the way of tax hikes passed this year.
Volatility rises, but stays under its highs
The VIX volatility index rose last week, peaking above 22 on Friday morning. However, it is nowhere near levels seen earlier this year (slightly above 33 on Jan. 29) and far below the level seen in late March 2020 (slightly above 65).3 I expect elevated volatility to continue this year, but I also expect it to remain well below those highs as markets adjust to higher yields on the long end of the curve.
What I don’t expect to continue …
One condition that I don’t expect to persist this year is that global stocks, namely the MSCI World Index, ended the week with a decline. While the second year of the stock market recovery is likely to be more challenging and volatile than the first, I believe global stocks will finish the year higher. I can’t help but be positive on risk assets given monetary accommodation, fiscal stimulus and a strong global rebound in the offing once vaccines have been broadly distributed.
A note from Kristina
I finish this blog on a somber note. Last week eight people, most of whom were Asian-American women, were senselessly murdered in the Atlanta area. My prayers are with the victims’ families.

Does “Buy low and sell high” do more harm than good?
It feels like a good idea, but markets aren’t mean reverting and have tended to go up far more often than they’ve gone down.
Perhaps the saying should be to “buy high and sell higher”
History shows markets have trended upward over long periods, so literally buying low can be unrealistic.

It’s the one-year anniversary of the 2020 market bottom.1 Time flies when you’re sitting by yourself in a home office all day.  A year ago, the swiftest bear market in US history — a 34% drop in the S&P 500 Index in 23 trading days — mercifully concluded.2 Since bottoming, the S&P 500 Index has advanced by 80%.3
Buy low and sell high, right?  It’s an adage that’s etched in our heads from the moments we contemplate our first investments. But do we recognize the low when it happens?  Alas, investors are often too panicked to invest when markets are “low.”  Case in point, investors allocated over $1.2 trillion into money market strategies from the end of February 2020 through the end of May 2020.4 Anecdotally, I had more friends predict Oral Roberts University to be in the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16 than I had predict the March 23, 2020, market bottom. 
Buy low and sell high feels like a good idea, but it’s often hard to do and misaligned with our emotional biases.  I fear that that the saying not only places unrealistic expectations on investors during bear markets, but worse yet may condition investors to not participate as bull markets advance.
And yet, as the market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index, trades near all-time highs (16 record highs this year and 49 since the COVID-19 outbreak5), I’m left wondering if the saying has done us more harm than good.  The challenge is that markets aren’t mean reverting and have tended to go up far more often than they’ve gone down. 
I’m often asked what I’ve learned over the past year.  Perhaps it’s simply that the saying shouldn’t be to “buy low and sell high,” but rather to “buy high and sell higher.”  Hear me out. 
The S&P 500 Index has closed at a new high on 1,101 days since 1957, or on average once every 15 days.6 In fact, the market closed at all-time highs in 275 of a total 2,015 trading days between 2013 and 2020, including 33 days in 2020 alone.7

Key takeaways
The players each team needs
Every team has a star who can lead their team in clutch situations, but it takes more than that for a team to win — whether in basketball or in business.
The traits of a leader
Preparation is key to gaining an advantage over the competition and earning the respect of your team.
The four D's of life
Dick talked about the importance of desire, dedication, determination, and discipline of the body and mind.

“I've got a body by ravioli, linguine, you name it, and yet I'm in the Hall of Fame because all my life I had one thing — passion and pride in anything I ever did.”
Those are the words of Dick Vitale — legendary ESPN college basketball analyst, former college and NBA coach, and a member of not one, but 14 halls of fame. He’s also a passionate and dedicated philanthropist who sits on the board of directors of the V Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by the late Jim Valvano that’s dedicated to finding a cure for cancer.
As the official asset manager of the NCAA, Invesco was honored to have Dick Vitale join us recently to talk about the lessons he’s learned throughout his career and the energy that continues to drive him at 81 years old.
Below are some highlights of his talk:
What it means to be a winner
Dick has a very simple definition of winning: “Winning's the ability of an individual in pursuit of any goal or dream to be able to look in the mirror and say, ‘I simply did my best.’”
“If you could look at that mirror every night when it's time to go to bed and say to yourself simply, ‘I want to be better today than I was yesterday,’ and if you can culminate that night by looking in that mirror head-to-head and saying, ‘You know what? I was better today than I was yesterday.’ And if you do that on a regular basis, that all equates to success. No doubt about it.”
Maintaining your energy
At 81 years old, Dick says he’s as energetic as any 18-year-old — and after listening to him speak, it would be hard to disagree. But where does his energy come from?
Some have speculated that his energy may be a way to compensate for losing the sight in his left eye when he was five years old, due to an accident with a pencil. “I don’t know how true that is,” he said. “ … But I've always been a guy that loves people, and I've always believed in trying to take care of myself.”
He starts each day with an hour of exercise, whether it’s walking or playing tennis. “I play against a lot of young people and I have a lot of fun doing it, but it's also great from a health standpoint and it keeps you energized.”
And he maintains a positive attitude. “I've always been a guy that's had a sense of passion and pride and always tried to look at the glass half filled, not half empty.”
The players each team needs
Every team has a star — or in Dick’s words, a “primetime performer” — who can lead their team in clutch situations. But for teams to win — whether in basketball or in business — it takes more than that, he says.
“You have to have what I call ‘the glue guys.’ The guys who do all the little things that aren't measured in statistics: Blocking out on defense, keeping guys off the glass, making sure you're diving for loose balls. You get the 50/50 ball that could go to your team or the other team, and he's diving, he's giving up himself ... If it means I've got to defend, if that means I've got to take a charge on defense, if it means I’ve got to make the extra pass to a teammate or an open shot, I'm going to do all the little things — and those little things equate to the big things and ultimately lead to the big prize that you're chasing.”
“Whether it be in the corporate world, whether it be in the legal world, whether it be in education, whether it be in sports — I want to be around those kinds of people. I want to be around people that care about performing that are unselfish.”
Being a leader
Leaders inspire their teams that they can get through hard times together, Dick said. “We're going to get through it because we're all going to do what it takes, the little things, to make it happen. We're going to have that little extra work ethic. We're going to be punctual. We're going to have respect. We're going to reach out. We're going to prepare.”
Preparation, Dick said, is key to gaining an advantage over the competition and earning the respect of your team. “I want to prepare as much as I can and know as much as my competition. I don't fear them, but preparation gives you confidence. Preparation gets you ready … (Your team) will respect you if you're going out and doing things in a proper manner. They're not going to respect you if you're not prepared.”
What the great players have in common
Dick said there’s a commonality among the all-time great players across all of sports. “These people are all about today, not about yesterday. Yesterday's history, it's a memory. It's a memory of what they achieved in the past. They'll all go look at that when they retire and they look at their scrapbooks and all their trophies.
“The bottom line is they care about today,” Dick continued. “They want to be better today than they were yesterday. They have that drive and desire that you just can't teach. I call it the four D's of life: Desire, dedication, determination, and a discipline of body and mind. And if you utilize that in the corporate world as well, you're going to be a success. You really are.”

Key takeaways
Investors fear the Fed
Stocks have been volatile due to fears about what the Fed would do if inflation rises.
But they also love its policies
While stock market investors fear the Fed, they also love its easy money policies.

Weekly Market Compass: Investors may be grateful for the Fed’s easy money, but they’re also wary about what might come next.
If you had to quickly describe the relationship status between investors and the Federal Reserve, your best bet might simply be: “It’s complicated.”
Stocks are moving up and down, and leadership in the stock market is rotating, based on market fears of inflation — or, to put it more accurately, fears about what the Fed will do if inflation does rise. But while stock market investors fear the Fed, they also love all the good things it has done for them. After all, the great stock market rally that began in March 2009 can be largely attributed to the Fed’s extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy — especially its quantitative easing. And the year-long rally that began in March 2020 has the Fed’s easy money fingerprints all over it. In other words, investors have developed a powerful bond — some might say a dependency — with the central bank.
The Fed’s reassurances have fallen flat
Now the good news is that the Fed is trying to be sensitive to investors’ wariness about what it might do next. Fed Chair Jay Powell doesn’t want stock market investors to worry. At every turn, he has tried to reassure them that the Fed will maintain its easy money policies for some time to come and that any rise in inflation will be transitory. Last week, for example, Powell was on Capitol Hill, providing comfort and reassurance. He made it clear that he wasn’t concerned about the rise in long-term bond yields, suggesting that they reflect growing optimism: “It seems that rates have responded to news about vaccination and ultimately about growth.” 1 Powell stressed that it has been orderly and that the Fed would only react if it is disorderly.
Powell reiterated that he doesn’t believe long-term price trends will be changed by the most recent fiscal stimulus package, supply-chain bottlenecks, or a surge in consumer demand, which is widely expected to come later this year as the economy re-opens. Powell said that while the Fed expects upward pressure on prices, he expects it will be transitory. He was emphatic: “Long term, we think that the inflation dynamics that we’ve seen around the world for a quarter of a century are essentially intact. We’ve got a world that’s short of demand with very low inflation … and we think that those dynamics haven’t gone away overnight and won’t.” 1 But investors didn’t believe him, based on the stock market reaction that day — they’re still wary that inflation will go up and the Fed will be forced to tighten.
It seems that market participants want to believe the worst of the Fed. They don’t believe Powell when he utters dovish words, but they latch onto any comments that can be perceived as hawkish. On Thursday, Powell gave an interview to NPR. He reiterated many of the reassurances he provided on Capitol Hill earlier in the week. He also shared his optimistic economic outlook for 2021. However, he also tried to be honest and transparent by stating the obvious: “… as we make substantial further progress toward our goals, we will gradually roll back the amount of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities we’re buying.”2 He talked about raising interest rates in the longer run, but said that such tightening would be very gradual and transparent. However, that sent stock market investors into a panic. The NASDAQ Composite Index, S&P 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all dropped significantly in just a few hours before investors regained their senses and started buying.

Investors have to wait and see how the Fed would respond to inflation
My best advice is that investors shouldn’t let the Fed — or any central bank — overly influence their long-term investment strategy. I believe the Fed will honor Powell’s pledges, but many market participants are clearly skeptical. These participants must come to terms with the fact that they won’t know if Powell will follow through on his assurances until inflation actually spikes and the Fed has the opportunity to insist it is transitory and sit on its hands. They won’t know if the Fed has really abandoned pre-emptive tightening until it proves to us that it has.
The silver lining of this environment — in which so many investors have allowed themselves to be dependent on the Fed — is that other investors can take advantage of “Fedspeak”-related sell-offs, which can create tactical buying opportunities for investors with a longer time horizon. And if markets actually become disorderly, I believe Powell will likely step in.
Is the Fed the only source of concern for investors? No, there are others. But the lesson is the same: Instead of parsing — and panicking about — every utterance from Powell and others, I believe investors’ time would be better spent focusing on fundamentals and long-term goals.
Looking ahead
In the coming week, I’ll be paying close attention to COVID-19 infections in Europe. The region is in the throes of a third wave of infections, which threatens to be the worst of the waves. This is not dissimilar to the third wave that the US experienced several months ago, which was its worst wave. Unfortunately, Europe’s vaccine rollout has been disappointing to say the least, and more infectious strains of the virus are spreading quickly. Lockdowns are being extended and could become more stringent as government officials warn that hospitals are being overwhelmed. This could further delay the eurozone’s economic recovery, which has already been delayed by the slow vaccine rollout. The ability to control infections in the eurozone is critical.
I’ll also be paying attention to China’s economy, with the government’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMI) and the Caixin manufacturing PMI being released this week. China’s economic recovery has been strong thus far this year, and I want to make sure there are no negative surprises in the offing.
I’ll also be following the volatility in stocks created by the fallout from the Archegos hedge fund unwinding. I think this is not dissimilar to the volatility created by Reddit-related stocks such as GameStop that we experienced earlier this year: I don’t see this as a source of widespread contagion, although it will likely weigh down some specific stocks over the shorter term. 
And finally, I will be paying attention to Friday’s US jobs report. I suspect non-farm payrolls will be very strong for the month of March, beating expectations, but could trigger a rise in the 10-year yield and concerns about inflation — and therefore stock market jitters — as investors are likely to worry again about whether the Fed will really sit on its hands …

Key takeaways
We’ve begun a new lunar year — the Year of the Ox
I am hopeful the ox is a metaphor for a global economy that gets moving again this year and proves to be strong and powerful.
The Federal Reserve (Fed) sticks to the script
Jay Powell reiterated that inflation is not a significant risk at this time and that the Fed will remain extremely accommodative.
Now more than ever, I believe diversification is key
Diversification could moderate the impact of the risk of a correction, inflation risk, and interest rate risk.

Weekly Market Compass: As we enter a new lunar year, the Fed reiterates its stance on inflation and stimulus.
We have just begun a new lunar year — the Year of the Ox. I think we are all happy to have said goodbye to the Year of the Rat — although I suppose we should have known this last lunar year was going to be bad because the Year of the Rat is traditionally considered to be a year of turbulence in which change or disaster can happen. Interestingly, the rat and the ox have an unusual relationship. As some of you already know, according to ancient mythology, many animals were in a Great Race to become the 12 animals chosen as the royal guard, which would then comprise the Chinese zodiac. The rat was unable to cross the river and so would not have been able to finish the race but tricked the ox into letting it ride on its back. Just as the ox was getting to the shore, the rat jumped off his back and beat the ox for first place. That is why the ox is the second animal in the zodiac sequence rather than the first.
The good news is that the Year of the Ox is traditionally viewed as calm, stable, and economically prosperous. The ox is strong and powerful. The ox is a hard worker. And the ox is active and moving. I am hopeful the ox is a metaphor for a global economy that gets moving again this year and proves to be strong and powerful, as populations are vaccinated and life begins to return to normal.
But this is not just the Year of the Ox. There are five elements associated with each animal — fire, earth, metal, wood, and water — and this is a year in which the element is metal. In Chinese Taoist thought, metal attributes include firmness, resilience, persistence, and determination. I hope these are the traits we see this year in the global economy — that it remains resilient, despite COVID-19 headwinds, until vaccines are broadly distributed. And maybe — just maybe — metal might symbolize the many syringes that will distribute the vaccine needed to achieve herd immunity and re-open economies. And so with that, let me wish everyone a happy lunar new year!
The Fed reiterates its messaging on inflation and stimulus
One of the big news items last week was the speech from Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jay Powell to the Economic Club of New York. Powell continued with the same two themes we have heard in other recent speeches: 1) inflation is not a significant risk at this time, and 2) the Fed will remain extremely accommodative. In supporting his first point, Powell reminded us of how much tighter the labor market was in February 2020 and yet inflation was relatively low. He explained, “There was every reason to expect that the labor market could have strengthened even further without causing a worrisome increase in inflation were it not for the onset of the pandemic.” In his speech, Powell emphatically pushed back on the idea that the economy might overheat with additional stimulus. He said it could take “many years” to overcome all the economic scarring caused by the pandemic.1
In terms of his second point, Powell stressed that the Fed would be “patiently accommodative”, having learned from mistakes made in the past. He stressed that maximum employment is a “broad and inclusive goal” and he showed real concern for the difficult labor market conditions of “the most economically vulnerable Americans.” He called for more fiscal stimulus and assured that the Fed would maintain very accommodative policy to support the recovery. Powell reinforced key points from his press conference following the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
Despite Powell’s repeated reassurances, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose to its highest level since last March, suggesting to many that inflation expectations have risen significantly. Because there are multiple factors influencing the yield on Treasuries, I prefer to follow the breakeven inflation rate — the spread between the 10-year US Treasury yield and the 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) yield. And yes, that spread has risen significantly in the past year to 2.21% — a level we haven’t seen in far more than a year — from a low of 0.50% on March 19, 2020.2 However, when I look back at the global financial crisis, the breakeven inflation rate went from a low of 0.04% in November 2008 to 2.37% in December 2009, suggesting concerns that inflation would rise substantially.2 The spread rose further in the ensuing years but proved to be a terrible predictor of inflation. Perhaps the same could happen again. And even if inflation were to spike very substantially, the Fed appears poised to view it as transitory and maintain its very accommodative stance.
Diversification may help cushion the risks facing today’s portfolios
Despite last week’s blog — or perhaps because of it — I continue to hear concerns about the stock market being in a bubble. To be clear, I remain positive about risk assets such as stocks, convertible bonds, high yield bonds and investment grade credit because of the monetary policy backdrop and because I expect a strong economic rebound this year. Yes, there are corners of the investing universe that could be in speculative bubbles, and there are parts of the stock market that have stretched valuations. And there is the real potential for a stock market correction in the near term — although I believe it would be viewed as an investment opportunity in this extremely risk asset-friendly monetary policy environment. I also recognize that sometimes recoveries from the bursting of a bubble can be long and drawn out, as we saw with Japanese stocks that peaked in 1989 and have yet to fully recover in price terms. But that is why I believe broad diversification within and across asset classes is so important; it helps moderate the impact of serious risks facing portfolios, such as the risk of a correction, inflation risk, and interest rate risk. Maintaining a long-term perspective, being well-diversified, adhering to an investment policy statement, and being disciplined and unemotional can all sound very boring in a world of skyrocketing cryptocurrencies and Reddit millionaires, but I believe it is necessary in order to achieve long-term investment goals.

Key takeaways
Overall economic activity is expected to return to its pre-pandemic trend by the end of 2021
This re-opening will likely also be supported by continued easy monetary policy and unprecedented government spending.
Despite this strong growth outlook, the Fed has signaled its intention to remain very stimulative
This is a marked change in the Fed’s reaction function from the past, when the Fed viewed its job as to progressively raise rates to avoid economic overheating.
Amid continued fixed income volatility, we favor credit over duration
With negative real yields in US Treasuries and a very strong economy, fixed income returns are likely to be lower than in recent years.

The US economy has been quickly moving to a post-COVID-19 world. As the vulnerable are vaccinated and the risk of death and hospitalization declines, we expect consumers to go back to activities that have been curtailed by the shutdown. This will likely benefit service industries, such as dining, hospitality, and travel, where there is plenty of capacity. Putting this spare capacity to work over a short period of time will likely lead to very strong growth for the balance of 2021. This service sector growth will be on top of an already strong goods-producing sector, so the overall level of economic activity is expected to return to its pre-pandemic trend by the end of this year.
This re-opening will likely also be supported by continued easy monetary policy and unprecedented government spending. US fiscal spending directly related to the pandemic is likely to exceed 20% of gross domestic product in total. This spending has bolstered balance sheets and allowed consumers overall to improve their household financial situations, even while the economy was in recession. Households are potentially in a better position to increase their spending as we exit the COVID-19 shutdown than before the shutdown.
Despite this strong growth outlook, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has signaled its intention to remain very stimulative and to keep interest rates close to zero for the foreseeable future. This is a marked change in the Fed’s reaction function from the past, when the Fed viewed its job as to progressively raise rates to avoid economic overheating. As William McChesney Martin, former Chairman of the Fed, famously said, the Fed’s job was “to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.” The current Fed has redefined this under the framework of Average Inflation Targeting (AIT),1 to now be along the lines of “let’s get this party going.”
This new AIT framework was clear at the March Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections revised up growth expectations and inflation expectations sharply, but made little change in projected short-term interest rates over the next three years. The Fed would like to see inflation durably above 2% and the economy at full employment before contemplating rate hikes. In other words, the Fed is likely to purposely allow the economy to overheat. For bond investors, this means that the Fed will not be raising rates anytime soon, and will keep the short end of the yield curve pegged close to zero. Strong growth and a tighter labor market will likely keep upward pressure on the longer end of the yield curve, despite the short end being pegged close to zero. On the other hand, there will likely be some support for longer-duration bonds from a global relative value perspective. Much of the global developed bond markets have negative yields, making the US attractive on a relative basis.
The interplay of these forces is likely to keep fixed income volatility high. Indeed, in recent months, fixed income volatility has risen even as equity volatility has remained low on a historical basis. In February, fixed income volatility rose while the Volatility Index (VIX), a widely followed measure of equity volatility, declined. This is an environment to favor credit over duration. With negative real yields in US Treasuries and a very strong economy, fixed income returns are likely to be lower than in recent years.
Currently US Treasury real yields (yield after inflation) are still negative across much of the yield curve, and real yields are unlikely to rise in the near term to a level that would mean a serious change to risk assets, in our view. The bottom line is that we expect a red-hot US economy complemented by an easy Fed to support risky asset markets in the near term. Upward pressure on the long end of the US yield curve is likely, and Treasury volatility may remain elevated, but we do not expect real yields to reach a level where they create an issue for growth or for risky assets in the near term.

Highlights

We expect rapid growth of the labeled sustainability bond (Figure 2) sector in 2021. This requires fixed income practitioners to broaden their research toolkits and take an active approach to differentiate between bonds with good ESG credentials and those that could disappoint.
To make this distinction, we believe it is vital to assess an issuer’s sustainability bond program. Invesco Fixed Income (IFI) considers such factors as the use of proceeds, the management of proceeds, and reporting and external verification to assess the alignment of sustainability bonds with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).
Labeled bonds, such as transition bonds and sustainability-linked bonds, introduce greater complexity into the investment research process. The silver lining is likely to be greater engagement with issuers, which we believe will only increase as ESG analysis matures.

We expect 2020’s significant growth of labeled sustainability debt1 issuance to continue (BNEF reported that USD530 billion was issued globally in 2020, up 60% year-over-year), partly fueled by the European Commission’s September 16 announcement of its intention to issue an additional €225 billion of sustainability bonds to help fund the response to the pandemic (more than issued by the whole market in 2017 or 2018).2 The growth of this segment, with many issuers bringing inaugural deals in 2020, is set to continue in 2021 and makes sustainability bonds an increasingly core holding for fixed income investors.
This evolving asset class poses several new questions to fixed income analysts and portfolio managers alike, requiring a broader analytical toolkit than our traditional new issue or environmental, social, governance (ESG) analysis. This means that a more active and research-intensive approach is required to differentiate bonds with good ESG credentials from those that could disappoint.

Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
Recent data has been positive
Mobility, which we have found to be a helpful indicator of economic activity, has increased substantially in Israel.
A preview of what’s to come?
In my view, Israel’s current state illustrates what we can expect in countries that achieve broad vaccination of their populations.
What might this mean for stocks?
I expect this economic recovery to be very robust, which may lead to outperformance by smaller-cap stocks and cyclical stocks.

Weekly Market Compass: Israel may provide a preview of what’s to come in the US and UK — and in any country that achieves broad vaccine distribution. 
A month ago, I wrote about the great progress Israel was making in terms of inoculating its citizens against COVID-19. At the time, I said that we would want to follow economic data in Israel closely for indications of what the US and UK could expect in the near future — as they are making swift progress in vaccinating their respective populations — as well as what any country can expect once it successfully vaccinates a significant portion of its population. Therefore, I think it’s worth re-visiting Israel to see the impact that widespread immunization has had on its economy. It’s clear that Israel’s vaccination program is not only having a substantial impact on consumer confidence, but also on spending.
Israel’s data shows the impact of vaccines
While vaccinations only began in December, they ramped up quickly. As of April 4, Israel has given at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine to 59% of its population, with 54% fully vaccinated.1 The economic impact was seen relatively early on. As morbidity moderated, restrictions eased and the third lockdown was rolled back — and the Bank of Israel's Composite State of the Economy Index for February increased by 0.4%.2
Mobility, which we have found to be a helpful indicator of economic activity, has increased substantially. By the end of March 2021, retail and recreation mobility (restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, movie theaters, etc.) was off by only 6% from January 2020 levels, while grocery and pharmacy mobility is actually higher than those early 2020 levels.3 And, not surprisingly, economic activity accelerated in March. Daily credit card data shows that the value of transactions for the week ending March 22 was actually 15% higher than it was in January 2020.4 By comparison, back in April 2020, the value of transactions was more than 40% below its level in January of 2020.4 The rebound in spending has been strongest in some of the areas hardest hit by the pandemic, especially leisure and tourism.
Why is this time different?
What makes this time different than past economic re-openings, like we saw in spring 2020? Before broad vaccinations, the re-opening of an economy was a double-edged sword. Typically, a re-opening would often be followed, after a lag, with an increase in COVID-19 infections. In addition, the increase in economic activity would typically be tempered because some consumers would be reluctant to go out and spend despite the re-opening because of health safety concerns.
I believe this time is different because vaccinated consumers will be more likely to re-engage in pre-pandemic economic activity and, according to medical research, should be well protected against COVID-19 — so spending should not be tempered as in past re-openings. Israel’s re-opening is already proving that vaccinations are leading to an uptick in consumer activity, and they haven’t seen another wave of COVID-19 infections.
A preview of what’s to come in the US and UK?
In my view, Israel’s current state illustrates what we can soon expect in countries such as the United States and then the United Kingdom — and in any country once it has achieved broad vaccination of its population. In the United States, 31% of the population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and 18% have been fully vaccinated.1 In the United Kingdom, 47% of the population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, although only 7.8% of the population is fully vaccinated.1
The US economy is already seeing significant improvement, further helped by fiscal stimulus. For example, the March employment situation report saw a far-better-than-expected increase in non-farm payrolls at 916,000.5 And we just got the ISM Services PMI for March, which was also far better than expected, clocking in at 63.7 with all 18 services industries reported growth.6 The only problem is that COVID-19 infections are on the rise in some states in the US, so vaccinations will need to maintain momentum in order to slow and ultimately stop the rise in infections.
The UK is a bit more complicated and hasn’t shown as much improvement yet because it remains at a relatively strict level of pandemic-related lockdown, although stringency is being eased gradually.

Investment implications
I expect that rising vaccinations and improving economic data are likely to lead to a continued rise in bond yields and outperformance of smaller-cap and cyclical stocks, especially in countries that are leading the recovery.
I should add that in the US, there are a few clouds on the horizon in the form of growing fears of rising taxes. And that is likely to be the case for a number of countries burdened with higher debt levels created by the pandemic. While far from a reality at the moment, if an increase in taxes becomes more likely — especially a large increase in corporate taxes – we could see some shift in leadership, albeit modest, to larger-cap and more defensive names. However, it’s important to stress I don’t believe this would end the stock market recovery, but could just cause some rotation in leadership.
But right now, the focus is on the virus and vaccinations. As the Brookings-FT Tracking Index for the Global Economic Recovery has indicated, the ability to control COVID-19 is likely to be the main determinant of economic success in 2021.7 That is why the index shows major economies such as China and the US leading the global recovery. The index suggests that there may not be a coordinated global economic rebound, but that instead there may be a time lag for some countries, especially Europe and Latin America, given their lack of progress in vaccine rollout and general difficulties in controlling the virus. This isn’t surprising — and it’s something we anticipated last year when putting together our 2021 outlook. In other words, we believe an economic recovery is in the future for all parts of the world, but its timing and strength will be dictated by control of the virus and vaccine rollout progress, and so we will want to follow this data closely.

Our 2020 ESG Investment Stewardship Annual Report provides a detailed view into company engagements, including case studies, Invesco’s proxy voting approach and social equity and climate change focus areas. We outline our new commitment to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) into all investments by 2023.
The report is focused on Invesco’s ESG Philosophy, which can be broken down into three core aspects:
• Materiality: The consideration of ESG issues on a risk- adjusted basis and in economic context. Invesco does not view ESG aspects as constraints, aside from certain restrictions driven by legal obligations in certain territories.
• ESG momentum: The concept of improving ESG performance over time, is particularly interesting. Invesco finds that companies that are improving in terms of their ESG practices may enjoy favourable financial performance in the longer term.
• Engagement: Invesco takes its responsibility as active owners very seriously and sees engagement as an opportunity to encourage continual improvement. Dialogue with portfolio companies is a core part of the investment process for its fundamental teams. Taking advantage of Invesco’s scale, the firm often participates in board-level dialogue and is instrumental in giving shareholder views on management, corporate strategy, transparency, and capital allocation as well as wider ESG aspects.
The 2020 Stewardship Report highlights the Company’s key advancements in ESG as well as impactful initiatives underway, including:
• Client Engagement: Invesco’s efforts to help manage, protect, and enhance the value of clients’ investments. We held over 2,000 engagement meetings with companies during 2020 calendar year, and the top 5 topics for Global ESG team engagements include:
        o   Climate Transition – 44.25%
        o   Executive Compensation – 22.21%
        o   ESG Disclosure – 14.16%
        o   Diversity – 12.39%
        o   Human Rights – 8.85%
• Climate Change: Invesco has committed to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and is part of the solution by supporting and investing in companies that are allocating capital towards the transition.
• ESGIntel:  A proprietary tool built by Invesco’s Global ESG research team in collaboration with our Technology, Strategy, Innovation and Planning (SIP) team to provide ESG insights, metrics, data points and direction of change.
• Industry Engagement: Invesco is an active member and supporter of several external organizations as well as participants in various industry advocacy groups, including:
        o   signatory of Climate Action 100+
        o   partner of the Climate Bond initiative
        o   supporter of the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI)
        o   member of the One Planet Asset Managers (OPAM) initiative
        o   signer of the Confluence Philosophy Belonging Pledge to Advance Racial Equity.
•  Proxy Voting: Invesco’s Policy Statement on Global Corporate Governance and Proxy Voting (Global Proxy Policy) sets forth the framework of Invesco’s broad philosophy and guiding principles that inform the proxy voting practices of the firm’s investors around the world.
• Social Equity: Invesco’s global initiatives include: a Women’s Network, an LGBT Network and a Black Professionals’ Network, among others.

The bond market is opening this week with a steady tone after a bout of Federal Reserve (Fed)-induced volatility sent yields to 2021 highs last week.  
The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee met last Tuesday and Wednesday and reaffirmed a strong commitment to the easy money policies currently in place. After months of public comments from various Fed officials stating as much, the Committee was able to articulate this commitment in a different manner with the release of their “Summary of Economic Projections.” These projections detail expectations for the future level of various economic statistics as well as their main policy tool, the Fed Funds Rate.
In the materials, the Fed upgraded its assessment of anticipated economic activity — projecting higher levels of GDP growth and inflation and a lower level of unemployment through 2023. Importantly, the Fed left its expectation for the Fed Funds Rate unchanged. This signals to investors that despite an improving economy, the Committee expects to keep the Fed Funds Rate at the zero bound and let the economy “run hot” for the next several years. It also indicates that the Fed is not overly concerned about future levels of inflation running well above the targeted 2% average level.
This lack of concern with future inflation triggered a rise in intermediate- and longer-term bond yields last week. As inflation erodes the value of future interest payments, investors often push bond yields higher when they fear inflation is set to pick up. With the Fed’s firm commitment to easy monetary policies, investors were quick to price in higher inflation.
The question we’ve been getting most often from clients in recent weeks is, “How far can this sell-off go?” This is a difficult question to answer as the level and direction of interest rate movements are based on many factors and are notoriously difficult to predict. However, bond bulls point to a few reasons as to why we are closer to the end than the beginning of the 2021 sell-off, including good news surrounding vaccine distribution and fiscal stimulus now being well understood by investors. Also cited are market-based measures of inflation expectations, which call for higher inflation over the next five years than the subsequent five years. Essentially, the market is predicting that inflation will slow during the back half of the decade after accelerating for the next few years.
Ultimately, this rise in yields is good for bond investors as maturities and coupon payments will now be reinvested into new, higher yielding bonds. There are also opportunities to tax-loss harvest and turn losses into assets. In addition, the performance of non-government sectors of the investment grade bond market, including municipals and corporates, have performed in line with, if not better than, Treasuries.
In short, this sell-off appears to be different than the often cited “taper tantrum” of 2013 in many ways. We believe that is good news for investors. 2013 was marked by significant downside volatility across most asset classes amid a belief that the Fed was backing off from market support. This time around, the bond market is signaling not only better growth, but a belief that the Fed is appropriately supporting financial markets.

Recent headlines from the financial market press have focused on the rise in US Treasury yields and what the increase will mean for bond and stock investors. This year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year Treasury yields have risen by 0.22%, 0.42%, and 0.48%, respectively. Importantly, with the Federal Reserve (Fed) pegging the overnight rate at the zero bound, short-term bond yields haven’t moved much — the two-year Treasury yield is essentially flat on the year.

Despite an increase in intermediate and long US Treasury rates over the past few weeks as investors price in a higher probability of additional fiscal stimulus, municipal yields have hardly budged, leaving year-to-date (YTD) returns for the sector slightly positive.

Much has been made of bond market performance in 2021. The rising rate environment has caused consternation for those concerned the sell-off we’ve seen is poised to continue.
Largely a result of economic optimism, government bond yields have risen globally as investors begin to price in higher levels of economic growth and inflation in a post-pandemic world. Here in the US, another large fiscal stimulus package is set to be signed into law this week; signs are emerging that there is large pent-up demand for various services; and the employment picture continues to improve. These factors have driven the yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury Note to 1.60%, up from 0.91% to start the year. 30-year Treasury yields stand at 2.29%, up from 1.65%. Importantly, short-term rates, which are closely tied to Federal Reserve policy, have been quite steady. Two-year US Treasury yields are currently at 0.15%, up just 0.03% this year.
For bond investors, a rising rate environment can be frustrating to experience. As yields rise, bond prices fall, with longer bonds especially sensitive to this inverse relationship. In the short term, this causes the total return on many bond portfolios to be negative. And while we understand that negative returns can be a cause for concern, there are many reasons for bond investors to be generally optimistic:

Higher yields typically mean higher returns over the long term.
Central banks are likely to remain highly accommodative, limiting the extent of the sell-off.
The opportunity to harvest losses and generate tax assets has improved.
Riskier sectors of the fixed income markets have performed well.

We entered the year acknowledging that the bond market was quite rich and positioned our portfolios accordingly. To date, the increase in rates has been a welcome event as we are reinvesting interest payments and maturities into new bonds that have more attractive yields than just a few weeks ago. We are also encouraged that the increase in government bond yields hasn’t had a major impact on other sectors of the market such as munis and corporates. One tail risk we cited in our 2021 outlook was another “taper tantrum” scenario, where a rise in rates caused downside volatility in many asset classes. So, while we understand the immediate reaction to negative returns to be that of concern, remember that for investors with individual bond portfolios, higher rates are a welcome sight.

2020 marked one of the more difficult years of our lifetimes as the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc around the globe. Yet, despite the lives lost and the economic damage done, financial markets logged a solid year. Why? In one word: policy.
In March, during a time of tremendous uncertainty, financial markets froze, and many assets experienced sharp and rapid downside price movements as investors raced for cash. In response, policymakers acted quickly and aggressively to backstop the economic and market fallout, enacting massive fiscal and monetary policy relief programs. These programs had an immediate effect and remain a key component of the general market dynamic today.

A side effect from the COVID-19 crisis has been a dramatic decline in sovereign bond yields, globally and here in the US. With the economy mired in a deep recession, inflation generally at low levels, and the Federal Reserve (Fed) indicating that it expects to keep short-term interest rates near zero indefinitely, it is no surprise that long-term rates have fallen as well. In fact, the yield on the closely watched 10-year US Treasury Note recently hit a record low: 0.51%.

It isn’t often that the Federal Reserve (Fed) updates its thinking around the dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, with which it was formally tasked by Congress in the late 1970s. In fact, the last update was made in 2012, when then-Fed Chair Bernanke quantified what price stability meant by formally establishing a 2% inflation target.
Since that time, reaching the 2% inflation mark has proven quite difficult, which is why the Fed recently embarked on a study of whether that goal should be revised. Last week, during the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, held virtually, current Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced the conclusion of that study, which detailed a small but important shift. Instead of having 2% inflation be a hard target, which may cause the Fed’s Open Markets Committee (FOMC) to tighten monetary policy, it will use 2% as an average target, meaning that the Fed will seek periods of above 2% inflation following an economic downturn that causes inflation to run below 2%.
The revamp is designed to address the “reality of a quite difficult macroeconomic context of low interest rates, low inflation, relatively low productivity, slow growth, and those kinds of things,” said Powell. “We’ve really got to work to find every scrap of leverage in helping stabilize the economy.”
What this means in practicality is that investors should not expect the Fed to raise the Fed Funds Rate anytime soon, even if the economy and employment rebound sharply from the current COVID-19 induced shock. Had this policy been in place after exiting the financial crisis, the Fed likely would have kept the Fed Funds Rate at the zero bound throughout the last decade, instead of raising it periodically from 2015 through 2018.
Of course, the Fed only controls the Fed Funds Rate, which typically sets yields on the very shortest of bonds. Longer-term interest rates are set by the market, with inflation being a key component. So, while this change in thinking by the Fed is historic, it may not be enough in and of itself to drive inflation higher. That will be left to the economy and variables such as money supply growth and velocity, technological innovations, and others. As of this writing, we are not seeing signs that inflation will meaningfully pick up but will continue to pay close attention as the market impacts from inflation could be significant, even if the Fed’s reaction isn’t.

Ken Frey
Senior Corporate Analyst


Corporate earnings season is more than half over and not as bad as feared.
Overall, revenues are down 12% while earnings fell 10%, but overall there have been more positive earnings surprises than normal. Getting the call right on revenues and earnings is difficult this quarter since most companies suspended guidance at the end of the first quarter and have yet to put their forecasting toes back in the water.
It is hard to fault the forecasting caution of management teams. As Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell said last week, the economy’s direction depends on how COVID-19 unfolds, and predicting this pandemic has proven difficult as both the science and the political response are still evolving.
What have unfolded are notable earnings takeaways in the banking, energy, and technology sectors. US banks took heavy credit loss provisions, which hurt earnings. But from a bondholder’s perspective, it is important to note that capital and liquidity are strong, and banks should come though the pandemic in good fiscal shape. Energy companies have been hit with oversupply and far less demand. While it will take some time to work down higher inventories, demand is anticipated to outstrip supply over the next few quarters, and if oil stays around $40, the large players should limp through to a slow recovery. Technology companies reported last week and by most accounts, it was a blowout quarter — great for online sales (but at the expense of brick-and-mortar retailers).
Corporate earnings are helped by three tailwinds: a weaker dollar, low interest rates, and a massive government fiscal response to the recession. The corporate index (which closely matches the S&P) will likely continue to benefit from higher overseas profits as the dollar weakens and low interest rates reduce the interest burden for many companies. And massive government spending supports consumption and helps to take some of the sting out of this recession.
Although tailwinds will provide relief, corporate earnings will be pushing a large stone uphill for a while longer until this pandemic eases and the economy returns to normal.  During this time, leverage will likely increase, which may spur credit ratings downgrades for those unprepared for bad times. As usual, selecting high-quality companies matters.

Key takeaways
A better outlook for the economy
The International Monetary Fund now expects the global economy to grow 6% in 2021 – the highest level of growth since 1980.
The Fed remains accommodative
The Federal Reserve also upgraded its economic outlook, but hasn’t changed its stance on accommodative monetary policy.
Fears of a ‘fourth wave’ continue
COVID-19 cases are on the rise in a number of countries, most notably Brazil and India.

Weekly Market Compass: The US and China lead the economic recovery, while fears of another virus wave grow in Brazil and India.
Last week was a shortened holiday week for many, and some are coming back to the office after spring vacations. Here is a brief recap of the key things you may missed last week.
IMF upgraded its economic outlook
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided a press briefing last week, sharing recent alterations to its global economic outlook for this year. The IMF now expects the global economy to grow 6% in 2021 — the highest level of growth since 1980.1 This is an upward revision from its previous estimate in October of 5.5% growth in 2021 for the global economy.
This is a reflection of the optimism created by the discovery and rollout of effective vaccines as well as significant fiscal stimulus, which is already having a positive impact on some countries such as the United States. It dramatically revised its growth expectations for the US economy in 2021 from 5.1% to 6.4%.1 The IMF modestly upgraded its expectations for economic growth in China in 2021 from 8.1% to 8.4%.1 One key takeaway from the IMF’s press briefing is that the world is on divergent recovery paths. The US and China, the two largest economies in the world, are leading the recovery, but other countries are experiencing a far slower recovery and are not expected to reach pre-pandemic GDP levels until 2023.
Eurozone PMIs point to improvement
The final eurozone composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) reading for March was 52.5 versus 48.8 for February.2 More importantly was the final services PMI reading for March: 49.6 versus 45.7 in February.2 We saw significant improvement in a number of countries including Ireland, the UK, and Germany. And so while it’s no surprise to me that manufacturing continues to strengthen, led by manufacturing powerhouse Germany, it is surprising — and encouraging — to see the services sector improving in some countries despite rising COVID-19 infections and lockdowns.
Chris Williamson of IHS Markit explained what is happening in the euro area: “The survey therefore indicates that the economy has weathered recent lockdowns far better than many had expected, thanks to resurgent manufacturing growth and signs that social distancing and mobility restrictions are having far less of an impact on service sector businesses than seen this time last year. This resilience suggests not only that companies and their customers are looking ahead to better times, but have also increasingly adapted to life with the virus.”2
This is good news, given that the vaccine rollout in the eurozone has been disappointing. While I don’t expect a robust recovery until COVID-19 is well controlled, the PMI readings suggest the economy can still recover in an environment of slow vaccinations and higher stringency.
FOMC minutes represent a ‘have your cake and eat it too’ moment
The Federal Reserve upgraded its economic outlook — but that didn’t change its stance on accommodative monetary policy. The minutes from the March meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) were released last week, showing that its growth expectations for the US economy in 2021 were — similar to the IMF — upwardly revised to 6.5% from 4.2%, while unemployment expectations were revised down to 4.5% for 2021 from 5%.3 The Fed’s optimism was driven by the economic re-opening and increased fiscal stimulus. The Fed also upwardly revised its expectations for inflation, forecasting 2021 core personal consumption expenditures to increase by 2.2% — this is a substantial increase from its previous forecast of 1.8%.3
In my view, these minutes represent a “have your cake and eat it too” moment — a Fed that expects the economy to experience strong growth — but will not pre-emptively tighten as it has often done in the past. The Fed is expecting a brighter economic outlook, but wants to remain very accommodative. The minutes stated that it will be “some time before the conditions are met for scaling back the asset purchase program” — and the Fed still expects rates to remain zero through 2023.3 In these minutes, the Fed once again reiterated its plans to sit on its hands well beyond 2021, anticipating that the spike in inflation it expects this year will be transitory. Investors couldn’t ask for a nicer Fed.
We heard lots of ‘Fedspeak’
We didn’t just get the minutes from the March FOMC meeting last week. We also heard from various Fed officials. Here are the highlights:

Last week Fed Chair Jay Powell suggested that COVID-19 infections are the biggest risk to the economy. He shared a cautionary message about the pandemic last week despite growing optimism about the economy: “Cases are moving back up here, so I would just urge that people do get vaccinated and continue socially distancing. We don’t want to get another outbreak; even if it might have less economic damage and kill fewer people, it’ll slow down the recovery.”4
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard shared his view that the Fed should not even consider any changes to its monetary policy until we have certainty that the pandemic is over. In my view, this could further delay monetary policy normalization given that it could tether future Fed considerations to health-related accomplishments.
Then, last night, Powell appeared on an American TV news show, “60 Minutes.” He reiterated that the principal risk to the economy is a resurgence of the pandemic. Powell stated that the US is “at an inflection point,” and he expects growth to be very strong in the back half of 2021. One important line from his interview, “The Fed will do everything we can to support the economy for as long as it takes to complete the recovery.”5

Signs of inflation in PPIs
The US Producer Price Index (PPI) rose substantially in March, exceeding expectations. However, markets barely flinched. And this rise in PPI is not specific to the US; China also experienced a big rise in producer prices. My view is that these data points are to be expected, a combination of base effects and short-term supply disruptions. However, that doesn’t mean we won’t want to follow future inflation data closely, including US Consumer Price Index this week.
Fears of a ‘fourth wave’ continue
The Fed’s concerns about COVID-19 are well-founded. COVID-19 cases are on the rise in a number of countries, most notably Brazil and India. Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official, described the situation in Brazil in stark terms, “What you are dealing with here is a raging inferno of an outbreak.”6 I believe concerns about infections, especially a rise in the spread of more contagious variants, will continue to be an intermittent cause of concern for markets.
So what happened in markets?
The big news is that the yield on the 10-year US Treasury backed down materially last week. This came as a surprise to many, given that the outlook for the economy continues to improve — as have expectations for inflation.
I think there are several possible reasons for this.  First of all, it could be a reaction to rising COVID-19 infections in parts of the world, which could be causing investors to actually lower expectations for growth. Similarly, all this talk of rising taxes in the US could also be dampening expectations about a very strong economic recovery. Or perhaps investors are finally starting to believe the Fed when it says it will not be tightening any time soon.
Not surprisingly, because yields backed down, there was a rotation within stocks. Stocks in general made gains last week, but technology stocks and other more growth-oriented stocks — as well as larger-cap stocks — assumed positions of leadership. Going forward, I would expect a continuation of this trend: rotations in leadership tied to changes in the 10-year yield. But make no mistake — I am in the camp that expects yields to rise this year. Despite last week’s downward moves, I expect the yield on the 10-year US Treasury to reach 2% or higher this year.
Looking ahead
There is a lot to look forward to in the coming week, from US retail sales to UK gross domestic product (GDP) to the business outlook survey from the Bank of Canada. Here are a few items I am focused on:

Eurozone retail sales. The services PMIs mentioned previously suggest that the pandemic and lockdowns don’t seem to be having as big an effect on the service sector of the economy. This data should help confirm that theory.
Beige Book. The Fed’s “Beige Book” is chock full of anecdotal information from businesses in the different Fed districts across the country. It gives you a real sense of what they are experiencing — and thinking about.
China GDP. China has clearly helped lead the economic recovery in the early innings. This will give us a sense of how strong that leadership has been in the last quarter, and what parts of the economy it has come from.
Earnings season. Earnings season begins this week. Many companies abandoned guidance in the midst of the pandemic, but I am hopeful we will get more guidance this quarter. Any kind of outlook will be valuable.
Global vaccination levels. As always, I remain most concerned about our ability to control the pandemic, and the speed with which we vaccinate populations plays a critical role. As Fed Chair Powell has made clear, he believes the pandemic is the greatest risk to the economy this year. When I went to receive my second COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, the physician’s assistant who inoculated me ominously warned me against laminating my vaccination card. She matter-of-factly explained, “You will be back periodically for boosters. This is not over.” That’s because variants are spreading, especially where COVID-19 hasn’t been controlled, and will likely make it quickly to other parts of the world. There is a funny expression in the US about the city perhaps best known for gambling and general fun that is arguably more decadent: “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.” But there is no such thing when it comes to a pandemic. What happens in Sao Paolo (or New Delhi or Paris or Amsterdam or Los Angeles) doesn’t stay there. It can happen everywhere. So we need to care about vaccinations everywhere.

Jennifer Gilmore
Head of Stable Value Portfolio Management


It’s no surprise that stable value remains a popular core menu offering for most defined contribution (DC) plans. The segment represents the third-largest DC allocation at 10.1% of all plan assets, accounting for more than $839 billion in stable value assets under management, with only target date funds and US large-cap equity strategies capturing larger shares of participants’ savings.1 Offered solely in qualified retirement plans, these low-risk strategies have been an important fixture in the retirement industry for more than 30 years,2 and have delivered a steady track record of attractive rates of return through a relatively high-yielding principal preservation option.
It is important to note, however, that not all stable value strategies are alike. Differences in manager style, structure, and performance consistency can significantly affect participants' investment experience. Consequently, plan sponsors and their advisors need to apply a rigorous level of scrutiny around manager analysis, potential risk/reward exposures, and overall benchmarking. 
In this article, we pose six initial questions that should be used to vet stable value strategies:

Why consider a stable value strategy over other capital preservation options?
How consistent is the strategy across process, investment team, and performance?
How experienced is the investment manager?
Is the portfolio structured to navigate full market cycles?
Should plan sponsors look to their recordkeepers or independent investment managers as providers?
How is the role of stable value evolving in modern plan design?

Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
What do investors want from cryptos?
Diversification and capital appreciation are two major goals for many crypto investors.
Reward potential is tempered by volatility
Bitcoin has had a meteoric rise, but when prices fall, they have tended to fall hard.
A cautious approach may be warranted
For those who want to invest, I would urge them to consider classic investment tenets such as diversification and regular rebalancing.

Weekly Market Compass: Investors of all sizes are wondering whether cryptocurrencies are right for them. These considerations can help guide your decision.
It’s about that time again — time to write another blog about cryptocurrencies. Not surprisingly, I received a deluge of client questions on cryptos last week given the Coinbase IPO and the record highs bitcoin reached earlier in the week (followed by the steep pullback in prices over the weekend).
Of course, the most common question I get is, “Should my portfolio have an allocation to bitcoin?” This is not dissimilar to the questions I got back in late 2017 when bitcoin was on a tear and there was a lot of media coverage of it. However, what’s different this time is that not only retail investors are asking me these questions but so are institutional investors.
The critical question about cryptos
When considering the inclusion of any asset class in one’s portfolio, we must ask the simple question: What will this asset bring to the portfolio? For an alternative asset class — investments beyond traditional stocks and bonds — usually the primary goal is diversification.
Historically, bitcoin has had a low correlation with traditional asset classes such as the S&P 500 Index. For example, from Jan. 1, 2011, through March 31, 2021, the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500 was 0.15.1 However, as bitcoin has become increasingly popular, that correlation has increased, hitting a much higher 0.66 for the period of Jan. 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021.1 This suggests that bitcoin may no longer offer as much in the way of diversification benefits as it previously did. However, that does not mean that other cryptocurrencies will not offer diversification benefits.
Of course, capital appreciation potential can be an important goal as well, and bitcoin has had a meteoric rise from just $314.50 on Jan. 2, 2015, to a new high of more than $64,000 early last week.2 And bitcoin could potentially move far higher if more retail and institutional investors choose to include it in their portfolios. However, it has also experienced extreme volatility and major drawdowns, as evidenced by the significant drop it experienced last week — after hitting that all-time high, it quickly fell to less than $54,000.2
Potential investors need to recognize this risk/reward profile. Since 2011, bitcoin has spent 93.6% of days trading beneath its highs.1 This compares favorably to gold, which over the same time period spent 98.4% of days trading beneath its highs, and compares unfavourably to the S&P 500 Index, which spent 86.6% of days trading beneath its highs.1 But importantly, on days when bitcoin was beneath its highs, it was trading on average 53.5% below its highs.1 By contrast, when gold was trading beneath its highs, it traded on average 25.6% below its highs, and for the S&P 500, that number was 3.8%.1 In other words, when bitcoin prices fall, they tend to fall hard. Other cryptocurrencies have also had strong price appreciation — and have been similarly volatile with substantial drawdowns. In other words, cryptocurrencies have historically offered significant reward and significant risk.
Other reasons for wanting to own alternative asset classes may include the ability to hedge inflation and the ability to hedge geopolitical risk. For example, some investors add gold to their portfolios in an attempt to hedge inflation, even though historically gold has only sometimes been an effective hedge against inflation. Because cryptocurrencies are relatively new, there is no long track record we can examine to determine whether any have historically offered these properties. It will remain to be seen if cryptocurrencies can provide hedges for such risks.
Four additional crypto considerations
Just a few other considerations investors should be aware of:

Regulation. First of all, there is the potential for regulation of cryptocurrencies. Now that is not necessarily a bad thing. For example, regulation could increase confidence in investing in cryptocurrencies. However, it could also mean additional costs, which could depress the prices of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, extreme regulation could result in the shuttering of local crypto exchanges and a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies.
The environment. Bitcoin is not the most environmentally friendly investment. Bitcoin averages around seven transactions per second, and each one requires a substantial amount of electricity: 951 KWh per transaction.3 I could envision some institutional investors coming under pressure from groups demanding divestment of environmentally unfriendly investments such as bitcoin. The good news is that other major cryptocurrencies use far less electricity.
Competition. Other than being the first successful cryptocurrency and a pioneering invention coinciding with the birth of blockchain, there is not much that makes bitcoin special. Other cryptocurrencies share some similarities with bitcoin, and it may very well be possible that as bitcoin approaches its terminal supply amount, another cryptocurrency that is more technologically advanced and efficient takes its place. This perspective complicates the exercise of asserting a long-term value to bitcoin.
Liquidity. Investors can be overwhelmed by the number of cryptocurrencies out there — it can be difficult choosing which ones to invest in. I suggest focusing on the largest cryptocurrencies given they are the most liquid: in addition to bitcoin, that includes ethereum, ripple, litecoin and perhaps a few others. However, investors should research the different attributes of each of these cryptocurrencies.

So, should bitcoin be in a portfolio?
And so for every client who asks me whether they should add bitcoin to their portfolio, I respond “it depends.” It depends on risk tolerance, investment goals and other factors. For those who believe cryptocurrencies are suitable for investment, I would urge them to consider a small allocation and to perhaps diversify among a number of major cryptocurrencies, since each has different characteristics. And I would favor diversification with other alternative asset classes such as gold and real estate. Regular rebalancing may also help investors to methodically take profits on upward price movements, and to take advantage of price swings lower, and active management should help as various cryptocurrencies rise and fall in investor popularity.

Key takeaways
The speed of the recovery is flattening across regions
The V-shaped rebound is beginning to normalize and most economies are starting to approach trend growth rates.
Along with economic adjustments, monetary and fiscal policy should buffer the impact of a second wave
The probability of a double-dip recession in Q4 2020 does not need to translate into the same economic and financial shock experienced with the first wave.
We expect the global economy to remain in a recovery regime in the near term
Despite recent underperformance in equity markets and increased volatility, our measure of global market sentiment suggests some resilience and confidence in the marketplace.

Macro update

The return of the coronavirus across Europe and the Americas represents an important risk factor for the global economic recovery. We contemplated this risk back in the spring and outlined a baseline scenario of a meaningful second wave of COVID-19 infections across the northern hemisphere upon the return of colder temperatures. The probability of a double-dip recession in Q4 2020 is certainly increasing across multiple regions, but it does not need to translate into the same economic and financial shock experienced with the first wave. A combination of ample monetary and fiscal policy support, together with economic adjustments and measures implemented over the past seven months, is likely to reduce the uncertainty associated with this second wave compared to the first. While it is certainly too early to draw definitive conclusions, as the situation remains very fluid, our forward-looking measures of economic activity and market sentiment continue to suggest the global economy should remain in a recovery regime in the near term (Figure 1).

The Invesco Oppenheimer International Growth Fund turns 25 this year
Despite changing markets and evolving trends, we’ve adhered to the same discipline in managing the fund.
We’ve learned that events don’t change trends
We find high-quality companies that we believe can monetize those trends sustainably, and buy them at prices that we believe represent good value.

2021 marks the 25th anniversary of the Invesco Oppenheimer International Growth Fund. Looking back, we were struck by how consistent the investment strategy has been since its launch on March 25, 1996. Markets have changed, once-in-a-lifetime events have occurred regularly, trends have evolved. However, we have adhered to the same discipline in managing the portfolio.

Looking back

Over the past 25 years, we’ve seen fascinating events, including the Asian financial crisis, the creation of the euro, the Y2K scare, the tech and housing bubbles, the global financial crisis, the European debt crisis, the industrialization of China and the commodity super cycle that it fueled, and of course, most recently, the coronavirus pandemic.

Lessons learned and looking forward

Among the most important lessons we learned from them are that events don’t change trends. And this is key to finding opportunities for the portfolio going forward.

We’re witnessing evolutionary trends. Light-speed fiber-optic communications and increased computing power have enabled everything from China’s manufacturing rise on “just-in-time-inventory,” to India’s call center jobs, to smart phones — introduced less than 15 years ago — and are continuing to have transformative effects on our lives. The emerging market world has changed dramatically as hundreds of millions of people have emerged from abject poverty; this is not only uplifting, it is reshaping consumer markets. The sequencing of the human genome and the medical treatments unspooling from that are also extraordinary to see.

How we approach these opportunities

We think about the forces that we refer to as MANTRA — the forces of Mass Affluence, New Technology, and Aging that are constantly Restructuring the world economy — and the structural growth trends they create. We find high-quality companies that we believe can monetize those trends sustainably. We buy them at prices that we believe represent good value. We hold them in our portfolio for many years (eight to 10 years on average) to let their returns on the capital that we have invested in them compound over time. And we continue exploring, all the while revisiting, testing, and challenging our assumptions, always trying to get better at what we do.

Our personal motivation for this work is the same as it has been from the beginning, 25 years ago on this portfolio for one of us, 16 years ago for the other. We simply feel extraordinarily fortunate to have the opportunity to do it. We’re naturally interested in history and global current affairs, in technology and the way the world is evolving. The heart of our job is to focus on these issues. Furthermore, we have a front row seat. We have access to senior corporate management teams around the globe, allowing us to talk with the corporate leaders who are literally changing the world and driving industrial evolution.
It is a privilege to be in this position and watch these changes unfold. For this privilege, we are grateful to our clients, who invest alongside us in our portfolio. We are honored by the trust they have placed in us. We know they are investing to pursue important life goals. We’ll continue to strive to prove worthy of their trust by serving as effective stewards of their valuable capital each day.

Key takeaways
The Bank of Canada turns hawkish
Bank of Canada announced that it would begin an early withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation.
Is a US capital gains tax hike in store?
The Biden administration anonymously floated a proposal for higher taxes, briefly rattling stocks.
Earnings season starts strong
S&P 500 Index companies are on pace for a potentially record-breaking number of positive earnings surprises.

Weekly Market Compass: The Bank of Canada took a hawkish turn, the Biden administration floated a tax hike proposal, and earnings season could break a record for positive surprises. Here’s a round-up of key events from the past week, and what we’re watching on the horizon.
The Bank of Canada to cut bond purchases
The Bank of Canada (BOC) is starting to take away the punch bowl even though the party is still relatively young. Last week, the central bank noted that the Canadian economy has already made a significant recovery — and that there has been an accompanying rise in inflation. In response, the Bank of Canada announced that it would begin an early withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation, cutting bond purchases by 25%.1
What does this mean? Some worry that this is the removal of the finger in the dam that will start a wave of tightenings by central banks in the back half of 2021. I disagree. While other central banks will need to begin tightening at some point, I don’t expect any major developed-world central banks to follow suit this year. The Bank of Canada has traditionally been more conservative than other central banks, so it makes sense it would be eager to begin reducing accommodation. In fact, I think it’s close to a miracle that it has been so accommodative during the pandemic. Of note, the Bank of Canada’s current bond buying program is purchasing 40% of the government bonds currently in circulation2 — I would imagine the central bank is looking for reasons to extricate itself from playing such an outsized role in the bond market.
So in my opinion, this appears to be the beginnings of monetary policy divergence, which is likely to continue in the coming year as different central banks around the world look to chart their own course. After all, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell continues to pledge that the Fed will remain accommodative far longer. And the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Christine Lagarde was very clear last week that the eurozone economy is on two “crutches” — one of which is monetary policy — and needs that continued support. She was emphatic that it is “premature” to discuss any future reduction in monetary stimulus, especially since she sees near-term downside risks.
Is a US capital gains tax hike in store?
The Biden administration anonymously floated a proposal for higher taxes — a large increase in the capital gains taxes for those earning more than $1 million in total income. Not surprisingly, this caused a brief sell-off for US stocks last week.
In my opinion, any proposal for a substantial increase in taxes would be dead on arrival, given the composition of the US Senate. Yes, the Biden administration could get some increase in certain taxes, but I don’t think any would come close to what has been proposed. Even so, we may see further volatility in stocks as the conversation about higher taxes continues. However, I continue to remain optimistic that we will only see modest increases in taxes in the next year.
Bitcoin stages a rally
Following my blog last week, bitcoin experienced several challenging days. A few different forces conspired against cryptocurrencies, including fear of taxes for cryptos, fear of regulation of cryptos, and general uneasiness after bitcoin hit a new high in the previous week.
But over the weekend, bitcoin staged a significant recovery, helped by a tweet from Elon Musk. I expect more of the same in terms of volatility. After all, if tweets can have such a big impact on price movements, I think we need to expect substantial volatility.
COVID-19 results continue to diverge dramatically
Examining the COVID-19 case count around the world, it’s clear that the highs are getting higher and the lows are getting lower. More people were diagnosed with COVID-19 last week than any other since the pandemic began.3 The World Health Organization has warned that new infections are increasing in many parts of the world, even as the US and Europe are seeing a decline in new daily cases. Sadly, India recorded more than 350,000 new COVID-19 infections on Sunday — the largest single day record for infections, and the fifth day in a row that India has broken the world record for most new infections.4 The good news is that the US has pledged to do more to help India with its vaccine rollout — a decision that is not just good for India but is good for the US and the world.
In terms of the highs getting higher, last week Israel saw only 38 new COVID-19 cases in a day — the lowest daily number in more than a year.5 In addition, last week Israel logged its first day without any COVID-19 deaths. 5 As I have said before, Israel is the gold standard when it comes to vaccinations. What it is experiencing now could be the future of any country that can achieve the same success in vaccinating its citizens. The US is getting closer to where Israel is, with more than 40% of the US population having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.6
Earnings season in the US is going well so far
Not surprisingly, earnings season this far has been strong. While only 25% of companies in the S&P 500 Index have reported thus far, 77% of them have reported a positive revenue surprise, and 84% of them have reported a positive earnings per share (EPS) surprise.7 If that 84% figure holds up for the entirety of S&P 500 companies, it would tie the record for the highest percentage of S&P 500 companies reporting a positive EPS surprise since 2008 when FactSet began tracking this metric.7
The week ahead
Two of the most important things on investors’ minds this week:

The FOMC meeting. After the Bank of Canada’s announcement last week, all eyes will be on the Fed to see if Powell’s hands are itching to follow Canada’s lead and start taking away America’s punch bowl. I don’t believe that will be the case. I suspect we will hear more of the same accommodative stance from Powell and his fellow Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants — far more similar to what we heard last week from the ECB’s Lagarde rather than BOC Governor Tiff Macklem.
Earnings. We will see some important earnings releases this week, including many of the giants of the tech sector, including Tesla, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and Amazon. I expect a continuation of the positive surprise theme for most stocks reporting this week — but outlooks will be even more important, and I expect those to be positive as well.

Key takeaways
Value on the rise
In September 2020, large-cap value stocks began to outperform large-cap growth as more state and regional economies made plans to re-open.
Room to run?
Importantly, we believe this value cycle has more room to run for two main reasons.
Open to opportunity
That said, we don’t expect the economic recovery to be linear, but to have periods of fits and starts.

If value stocks haven’t been on your radar screen in a while, you’re certainly not alone. After all, growth has been in favor for years, and 2020 saw the worst performance of value stocks in many decades as COVID-19 wreaked havoc with the economy.
But I believe it’s time to pay attention to value.
In September 2020, large-cap value stocks began to outperform large-cap growth as more state and regional economies made plans to re-open. In the six months from September 2020 through February 2021, value outperformed growth by almost 14 percentage points, the biggest outperformance of value in more than a decade.1
This shift isn’t terribly surprising — value stocks have historically outperformed when the economy is coming out of a recession and as the business cycle turns positive, which is what we’re experiencing now.2 But in our view today’s environment is uniquely positive for value stocks for several reasons 

With multiple vaccines in circulation around the world, COVID-19 risks are decreasing, which is supportive for economically sensitive stocks.
An accommodative Federal Reserve is the most dovish in history. 
Under the Biden administration, massive stimulus and a possible infrastructure package should drive business activity.
Inflationary pressures have been rising. As long as these pressures are measured (which we expect them to be), we believe this is a linchpin for sustainable economic growth.
Many companies slashed costs due to the pandemic.  We expect this to result in operational leverage as demand recovers.

Room to run?
If value stocks are just popping up on your radar screen, you may be wondering whether you’ve missed the opportunity. Importantly, we believe this value cycle has more room to run for two main reasons.
First, as illustrated below, the relative forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of value has been trading at a near record discount versus growth.

Invesco Developing Markets Fund has holdings in luxury good ateliers of Western Europe
While these companies are domiciled in developed markets, we believe they offer a uniquely robust structural growth opportunity that’s principally driven by the developing world, most notably China.
Why are we invested in these companies?
We believe they have the ingredients we look for across all our investments: durable growth, sustainable advantage, change and real options that may emerge over many years.

In the past decade, Invesco Developing Markets Fund has invested considerable research — and capital — into the luxury good ateliers of Western Europe. While these companies are domiciled in developed markets, we believe they offer a uniquely robust structural growth opportunity that’s principally driven by the developing world, most notably China. Our wide-ranging approach to investing in extraordinary businesses that operate in emerging market (EM) economies has led us to this unique opportunity.
Today, we have approximately $3.9 billion invested (or 8.3% of the fund’s AUM)1 in five luxury houses, which makes us one of the largest investors in this niche consumer discretionary industry. Three of these investments – Kering, Richemont and Prada – are particularly meaningful, representing 7.9% of AUM.1
Why we are invested in these companies

We invest exclusively in businesses with characteristics of sustainable growth, durable advantage, and real options that we believe will unfold, often over many years. Rising affluence in the developing world coupled with the pervasive rise of social media (and in our view, the consequential social anxiety and desire this has created) are pivotal drivers of accelerated growth in the luxury good industry. 
New geographic leadership. Luxury’s extraordinary pivot to China has become one of the most inexorable themes to EM investors, with Chinese nationals accounting for 35% of the global personal luxury goods purchases in 2019, up from merely 1% in 1995.2 Structurally, China is on track to contribute approximately half of all luxury goods consumption by 2025.2 In fact, mainland China has become the single largest growth driver for the luxury goods industry worldwide — it was the only region globally to end 2020 on a positive note, growing by 45% to reach €44 billion,3 driven by re-shoring of consumption with pandemic travel restrictions.
New channels. Amid consumers’ rising affinity for digital discovery, big online luxury retailers like YNAP, Farfetch and Tmall are offering the increasingly diverse luxury consumer base with comprehensive and tailored multibrand shopping experiences, with enhanced curatorial and fulfillment capabilities for customers. And more importantly, they’re expanding the catchment area for brands given enormous distribution reach and better targeting data. 
New models. Furthermore, innovative luxury resale businesses like the Real Real are also conducive to a more diverse and inclusive industry ecosystem, with circularity initiatives increasingly endorsed and adopted by socially responsible leaders like Kering.
We focus on durable advantages in the highly competitive luxury good industry
We are interested in structurally advantaged companies and are long-term investors in scarce, extraordinary brands. We’re not inclined towards investing in transient brand momentum (a.k.a. fashion trends). As mentioned previously, our significant investment in the industry is concentrated on three high quality companies that balance heritage with innovation, and marry creativity with rigorous industrial execution.
Scale has become increasingly critical in this business, particularly with the demise of traditional wholesale models (multibrand retail and department stores). As direct control over distribution has become far more relevant, operating leverage has increased across the industry. Despite the evolutionary shift towards digital commerce, we believe luxury goods will remain a retail network-oriented business with high-cost real estate in key global cities. Control of distribution — both in directly operated stores and through brand.com and e-concession businesses — is extremely important, both to maintain profitability in the short term and to maintain brand strength over time. 
Scale is also important given heightened digital transformation investment requirements. These include higher capital expenditures to support digital channels and greater communication expenses to manage the increasingly fragmented digital communications channels. 
Successful companies must consistently invest across the business to generate a positive feedback cycle of growth and market share gains, most notably in product innovation, multi-channel distribution and communications. After decades of relative operating stability, change is accelerating across the industry. These changes include:·        

New consumers (China, millennials, Gen-Z) with different values and product and communication preferences (collabs, “drops,” streetwear, activism). Gucci’s stratospheric growth under Alessandro Michele illustrates that the winning brands in the industry are increasingly those that resonate well with millennials and respond to the new cultural values of the moment. Consumers demand intelligent and disruptive product projects like the Aria collection and Vuitton’s artist collaborations — which are subtler than simple co-branding, taking iconic pieces and molding them into something new. The younger customer cohorts have a completely different set of values and creative expectations around sustainability and inclusion. Balenciaga has overhauled the traditional norm of luxury communications, garnering high engagement through unconventional branding initiatives including launching an eccentric collection through video games and posting wacky yet enlightening social media content that is at the polar opposite of the carefully curated “shoppable” posts created by peers. 
New, more fragmented digital communication channels. Social media and “influencer” endorsement models have expanded reach and awareness, but require constant “newness,” increasing business complexity. Gone are the days when fashion rules were made by the fashion editors, and when consumers turned to Vogue to learn how to dress and to follow the latest trends and hot brands. Most luxury brands are devoting more than half of their marketing spends to digital channels, as opposed to traditional print media and extravagant catwalks.
New distribution. Higher capital requirements to wow consumers at the store (with events, exhibits, pop ups, exclusives) are coupled with substantial investments in omnichannel and multibrand digital commerce platforms. All this implies that the long-term winners will have to invest in gaining greater direct control of distribution — in both physical and digital channels — to both improve economics and sustain long-term brand strength. 
New business transformation technologies to improve decision making and operational excellence — customer relationship management systems, analytics, merchandising, logistics, IT. And omnichannel initiatives that enable consumers to enjoy a more seamless experience (in store and online) and improve business economics by capturing greater consumer data to inform creative direction, collections and merchandising, and supply chain and inventory management.

Alongside sustainable advantage, we spend most of our research time thinking about real options embedded in the businesses we invest in. Real options are particularly visible in the long tail of smaller brands which are being increasingly nurtured by conglomerates. The transformation of many ateliers in the LVMH universe has been dramatic over the past decade of acquisitions — Loro Piana, Bulgari, and the consolidation of Christian Dior. We think Kering and Richemont, the other two large conglomerates, demonstrate the same potential with brands such as Saint Laurent, Bottega Venetta and Balenciaga having a wide tarmac of growth potential across geographies and product categories as conglomerate synergies are optimized over time. 
Conclusion
We are investors in extraordinary business across the developing world. And in our view, some of the greatest brands in the developing world — including almost the entirety of the luxury goods businesses — are domiciled in Europe. We have become amongst the largest global investors in a clutch of these wonderful business that have the ingredients we look for across all our investments: durable growth, sustainable advantage, change and real options that we expect to emerge over many years.

Key takeaways
Investors are having a ""MEH"" moment
The US is in a “MEH” market environment right now: Monetary policy-driven, Entitled and Hesitant.
Good news is being overshadowed
Given this “MEH” environment, investors largely dismissed the positive economic developments we saw last week.

Weekly Market Compass: Sometimes good economic news isn’t good for stocks. Here’s why we’re seeing such a moment right now.
Well, last week was a real “meh” moment for markets as US stocks shrugged off the news of strong earnings. Certain high-profile companies reported strong results, and 86% of S&P 500 Index companies have beaten market expectations so far, with 60% of the index’s companies reporting.1 But despite those strong results, the S&P 500 Index closed the week virtually flat. Let’s face it — the US is in a “MEH” market environment right now: Monetary policy-driven, Entitled and Hesitant. And that may make it harder for good news to have a market impact. Let me explain:

Monetary policy-driven. The current stock market rally began because the Federal Reserve stepped in and provided unusually extraordinary monetary policy accommodation. As in the global financial crisis, I believe today’s monetary policy intervention has distorted risk and reward profiles for asset classes — and markets in general. When monetary policy is extremely accommodative, investors are more likely to cheer disappointing news and boo positive news because they want to see that accommodative stance continue. And so being driven by monetary policy carries with it certain risks — most notably that the stock market has clearly become extremely dependent upon very accommodative monetary policy. The very thought of beginning to reduce monetary policy support is likely to be jarring to markets if only in the very short term — think of the Taper Tantrum in 2013 (where the Fed pulled back from their quantitative easing program, causing rates to rise and stocks/credit to sell off).
Entitled. In my opinion, investors were simply unfazed by the blowout earnings from a number of high-profile companies. If anything, they seemed entitled to all the strong earnings reports. As stated earlier, we are now at the point where 60% of S&P 500 Index companies have reported earnings for the first quarter, with 86% of them beating earnings estimates.1 And these earnings “beats” aren’t small. The average beat is 22.8% above estimates, which compares very favorably to the five-year average of 6.9% above estimates.1 Last week’s market behavior leads me to believe that this quarter’s strong earnings season has been priced into stocks, and that next quarter will need to be better to sustain momentum. But I should add that I’m not worried, as I expect an even better positive surprise in the second quarter. As Apple CEO Tim Cook mentioned last week, increased sales, especially in China, reflect ""optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead for all of us.""2
Hesitant. The stock market is cautious. After all, stocks have already rallied dramatically, and there are concerns about the unsustainability of the current very positive environment given that government debt is growing and higher taxes are expected. This caution is also borne of being monetary policy-dependent, because sticky inflation could be around the corner, and that might force the Fed to remove the punch bowl (as we’ve already seen the Bank of Canada start to do). For example, last week we saw the price of lumber skyrocket. And this is not an isolated phenomenon — the prices of many materials are on the rise. But so far we haven’t seen any dramatic increase in inflation, and I remain optimistic that any rise in inflation would be transitory, the product of a surge in spending as the economy re-opens and re-accelerates, but that spending ultimately normalizes. Last week we also got the sense that there may be cracks forming in the united front of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC): Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said that he is seeing ”excesses and imbalances in financial markets,”3 suggesting it is time for the Fed to discuss a reduction in its bond purchase program. Investors certainly aren’t ready to hear that a few strict chaperones at the Fed may want to pull away the punch bowl soon. Finally, there is still underlying concern about the pandemic. As I mentioned in a previous blog, the tragedies occurring in countries such as India and Brazil also present massive risks to the rest of the world. When the virus is able to spread so rapidly and broadly, it increases the chances that mutant strains might develop — including ones that may be resistant to current vaccines. It was reported last week that 41 cases of the mutant double strain of COVID-19 that originated in India have been found in Israel — and that strain has infected some people who had already been vaccinated.4 While it is believed that the vaccines will be somewhat effective in at least minimizing the impact of the virus, this is not the news anyone wants to hear.4

Positive data gets overshadowed
Given this “MEH” environment, investors largely dismissed the positive economic developments we saw last week. And there were quite a few:

We got a phenomenal number on Chicago-area manufacturing for April, clocking in at 72.1.5 This is the highest level since December 1983, and I believe it gives us a taste of what’s to come in terms of strong manufacturing growth across the US in coming months as the economic recovery heats up.
US household income rose 21.1% in March.6 Of course, that comes after a disappointing February and seems largely the result of significant stimulus, but it does indicate that fiscal stimulus is very likely to help juice consumer spending in coming months.
The price of copper hit $10,000, near an all-time high, on expectations of a strong global economic recovery — and a substantial infrastructure spend.7 Since my earliest days in the industry, I have known copper as “Dr. Copper” because of its history as a leading indicator of economic expansions. In my opinion, this development underscores the potential for a strong economic recovery.
The FOMC held its regularly scheduled meeting last week and made clear the Fed remains very accommodative despite all the economic progress — and signs of rising prices — we have been seeing.

There is even concern among some clients that we could see a significant correction this summer. While such a correction is entirely possible, I can’t help but ask — how much farther could the stock market climb before any potential correction? What I have learned in more than 25 years following markets is that humans are terrible market timers. In my view, it’s better to stay invested and well-diversified in order to ride out all kinds of market environments, including the “MEH” markets, than “proactively” abandon stocks because of correction fears.
Looking ahead
This coming week, there will be many economic data releases globally, but the one garnering the most attention will be the US jobs report for April. I expect we will see strong job creation — a blowout. And that might present a problem for investors who are already anxious and monetary policy dependent, as a strong jobs report would give the Fed one more reason to start normalizing monetary policy. However, I can’t stress how important it is for investors to take a step back and not worry about what happens in the short run. Perhaps investors might even be willing to take time to actually enjoy watching the strong global economic recovery, with China and the US in the lead, and many other economies following close behind.

Over the course of history, humans have become richer
One of the first things people do with more money is spend it on higher-quality food.
Quality may now supersede price in consumers’ decisions about what to eat
This structural change in consumer preferences has created growth opportunities for a number of companies.
We see several interesting growth opportunities
Farmed fish, innovative cooking technologies, and premium mixers are just a few areas we’re watching.

As part of our investment approach, we look for opportunity that arises from the structural changes going on in the world. One of the most powerful, consistent, and underappreciated changes of the past several decades is that quite simply, people around the world have gotten a lot richer.1 And history has shown that as people get richer, one of the first things they do is to spend up on better-quality, more nutritious foods for themselves and their families. This simple fact has a host of investment implications across the developed and emerging worlds. In emerging markets, the rise out of subsistence living for billions of people has provided the discretionary income to be more selective about what they eat. In developed markets, consumers are directing more of their food dollars to things that not only taste good, but which are also nutritious and free of harmful additives. We believe this massive structural change in consumer preferences has created very tasty growth opportunities for a number of companies.
Growth opportunity #1: Consumption of farmed fish may continue to rise
If you talk to a random sample of people around the world, they’d probably tell you that overall, they’re eating a lot more fish than they have in decades past. The numbers back this up. In the 1960s, the average person ate just 21.8 pounds of fish per year, according to a United Nations report.2 50 years later, the level of fish consumption had doubled to more than 44 pounds.2 However, this huge increase creates major concerns about sustainability and overfishing of the world’s oceans. Indeed, over the past several years, the growth rate of the world’s wild catch has plateaued, 2 leaving consumers searching for other ways to satiate their appetite for fish.
Since the 1960s, the proportion of the global fish catch originating from fish farms has expanded from practically nothing to exceeding the total volume of fish caught in the wild in recent years.2 The world’s largest supplier of farmed salmon, a fish that is nutritious but notoriously hard to farm, is a company called Mowi. Based in Norway, a country whose fjords provide the perfect growing conditions for this fickle fish, Mowi sells more than 440,000 tons of salmon to more than 70 markets around the globe.3 The company has been a major advocate of sustainable approaches and a developer of innovative techniques in the field of fish farming. In an era when there are major concerns about feeding the world’s growing population and overfishing of the world’s oceans, we expect a continuing tailwind for this farmer.
Shrimp is the most popular fish consumed around the world, but salmon actually overtook canned tuna to take second place in the US in 2018.4 Salmon is popular globally as well. It is hard to believe before the 1980s there was no salmon sushi in Japan, but after a successful push by Norwegian salmon producers to sell their farmed salmon in Japan, salmon sushi and sashimi are now available everywhere. Salmon is both nutritious and tasty, and it’s been described as a “gateway fish.” This helped Japan’s sushi gain popularity globally.
As people eat more fish, they also want a way to verify its quality and origins. Seafood fraud is a major problem across the food industry. A recent study from Oceana, a conservation group, showed that 21% of seafood samples they tested from restaurants, markets, and stores were something other than what the label said.5 The most common form of fraud sees an expensive fish, such as sea bass, replaced by a visually similar but much cheaper fish like giant perch or Nile tilapia. This is where the Luxembourg-based Eurofins Scientific comes in. The company has a broad-based diagnostics and testing business; one of its services is a DNA-based technology that distribution companies can use to identify fish samples. A label can then be used to prove that a premium fish is fresh and exactly what it is supposed to be. As a result, suppliers, restaurants, and consumers don’t have to worry that a lower-quality substitute is pretending to be something it’s not.
Growth opportunity #2: Higher-quality ingredients are in demand
Shake Shack is a chain of restaurants that has capitalized on consumers’ appetite for a “better burger.” The beef they use is free of antibiotics and hormones, their custards are flavored with real sugar, and even the bacon that tops their famous Smokeshack burger is made without MSG or nitrites. I believe this attention to quality ingredients makes a real difference to the taste of Shake Shack’s food, and people have demonstrated they are willing to pay a premium price for a more premium experience than what the biggest names in fast foods offer.
Since its origin 20 years ago as a single hot dog cart in New York’s Madison Square Park, the chain has grown to encompass more than 250 locations all around the world.6 Whether in downtown New York or in the Tokyo airport, long lines of customers appear to be a regular sight outside of Shake Shack locations, and we think they can continue their growth while maintaining their distinction from the more common burger establishments that seem to be on every corner.
The global appeal of burgers shows that people may have the same tastes worldwide, even if they historically have had very different cuisines. And it is not surprising that burger restaurants are where innovations like plant-based meat have seen much success. There are many different companies making meat from non-animal sources, and Novozymes can help this process to get the right texture and taste by providing specialized enzymes.
Growth opportunity #3: The at-home cocktail trend may boost the appeal of premium mixers
Luxury liquor is one of the fastest-growing segments of the alcoholic beverage industry, growing at a 9.2% annual rate over the past five years.7 When it comes to consuming these premium spirits, I believe customers have increasingly demanded a premium mixer to go with them. This trend has been a strong tailwind for Fevertree, a British company that makes high-quality seltzers, tonics, and sodas. Their beverages come in smaller cans and bottles that are pre-measured to be the ideal size to make a premium mixed drink. This market is one of very few where the luxury brand actually has a higher market share than competing non-luxury brands. For many people, paying a small premium for a quality tonic to mix with their gin is the type of affordable luxury that can become a regular part of their lives. The pandemic has increased the consumption of at-home cocktails,8 and we expect it to continue for some time to come.
Growth opportunity #4: Cooking technology innovations can transform the foodservice industry
During this pandemic, a French neighbor of mine began baking at home and started a service delivering hot-out-of-the-oven French baguettes. It reminded me that there is no better comfort food than freshly baked bread, but not everyone has the luxury of an unemployed French neighbor, and neighborhood bakeries have shut down in many cases. Rheon Automatic manufactures automatic bread machines. I can see a future where every corner deli has the equipment needed to make fresh bread daily for everyone to enjoy.

Innovation in cooking technology allows restaurants, cafeterias, caterers, and schools to cook healthy food quickly, efficiently, and in small spaces. Rational has a line of combination ovens that can roast, poach, bake, steam, and more. The appliance is programmable, so you can cook without constantly watching the food, and repeat the same process accurately each time. Rational recently came out with a new appliance, the iVario, that can shallow-fry, deep-fry, pressure cook, and more, in a shorter time, using less energy.
The bottom line: Consumers may be willing to pay for premium quality 

Of course, higher-quality food, of course, often comes at a premium price, but consumers have made it clear they’re willing to pay more to achieve a better-quality experience, in my view. That willingness may also provide some protection from the impact of competitive pricing for these companies, an important characteristic for the types of long-term investments we’re interested in.

As investors, we are always looking for trends that can drive sustainable, long-term growth for companies. We believe the trend of consumers directing a larger portion of their food budget toward higher-quality — and higher-margin — options is here to stay.
As of March 31, 2021, Invesco Global Opportunities Fund had 1.05% of assets invested in Mowi ASA, 2.03% in Eurofins Scientific, 1.20% in Shake Shack, 0.34% in Novozymes, 0.63% in FeverTree Drinks, 0.66% in Rational, and 0.11% in Rheon Automatic Machinery. Holdings are subject to change and are not buy/sell recommendations.

Key takeaways
Is the economy stalling?
I say definitely not, given that we are seeing so many other signs of an economic recovery.
What’s creating the labor shortage?
Health concerns, childcare challenges, public transportation schedules, and government benefits may all play a role.
So where do we go from here?
I expect 2021 to be a good year for the economy and the labor market.

The April 2021 jobs report was a shocker — a huge miss. It was estimated that non-farm payrolls would grow by slightly below 1 million, while whispers on the Street suggested some expected well over 1 million. But it was not to be — the US saw a relatively paltry 266,000 jobs created in the month of April.1 And what’s more, March’s jobs report was downwardly revised from 916,000 to 770,000.1
Is the economy stalling?
Many people don’t know what to think about the jobs report. Is it a sign that the economic recovery is stalling? I say definitely not, given that we are seeing so many other signs of an economic recovery. For example, both US Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indexes have risen substantially in recent months. But that doesn’t mean we should have expected a blowout jobs report. The economy is accelerating but it’s not accelerating dramatically — at least not yet. After all, if we go back and look at the most recent Federal Reserve Beige Book released April 14 covering the six-week period ending April 5, it reports that national employment growth “picked up over the reporting period, with most Districts noting modest to moderate increases in headcounts.”2
In my experience, “modest to moderate” increases don’t typically make for a million non-farm payroll month in March or April. And we can’t overlook the role supply chain disruptions might be playing in causing manufacturing shutdowns that in turn have reduced the number of workers needed. That’s certainly what we heard from the San Francisco Fed in the most recent Federal Reserve Beige Book: “… a few contacts throughout the District in the utilities, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors mentioned scaling back work hours, reducing hiring activities, or stipulating hiring freezes. These cost-cutting decisions were brought about partially by shortages in input materials, disruptions to supply chains, and a tightening of capacity constraints.”2
Are generous unemployment benefits creating a labor shortage?
Or does the jobs report indicate that fiscal stimulus — specifically enhanced unemployment benefits — is creating a worker shortage? Many of us are hearing anecdotal information about employers’ attempts to attract workers: the $500 sign-on bonus Wawa is offering, the bonus McDonald’s is offering just to show up at a job interview. A friend of mine texted from North Carolina to say that her favorite fast-food restaurant in town is closed because the owner owns two locations but only has enough employees to staff one of them — so each is closed half the week.
The US Chamber of Commerce agrees; it believes a worker shortage is being created by additional unemployment benefits. It says it performed an analysis that indicates one in four employees now receive more money in unemployment than they earned working.3 In the wake of the April jobs report, the Chamber of Commerce actually called for a cessation of the extra $300 unemployment benefit: “Paying people not to work is dampening what should be a stronger jobs market. We need a comprehensive approach to dealing with our workforce issues and the very real threat unfilled positions poses to our economic recovery from the pandemic.”3 And that was echoed by a number of Fed districts in the most recent Beige Book. In other words, employers have jobs to offer — it’s just that no one wants to fill them.
But is that the whole story?
I think the situation is more nuanced — that there are additional reasons why there is a scarcity of available labor in some regions and industries. One theory is that some parents may not be able to return to work because their children’s schools are still online and/or there may not be enough available childcare. That seems to make sense. I know a number of parents whose children only started going back to school in person in the last several weeks, while others are expected to finish out the school year online, with a resumption of full-time in-person instruction not anticipated until the fall of 2021.
Childcare and other challenges such as health safety concerns and a reduction in available public transportation have all been obstacles for those trying to return to work. This was noted by the Chicago Fed in the most recent Beige Book: “Employers, temp agencies, and workforce development organizations pointed to a number of factors limiting labor supply, including health safety concerns, childcare challenges, cutbacks in public transportation schedules, job search fatigue, and financial support from the government.”2  These obstacles fall under the broader category of mobility and commerce restrictions, a problem articulated by the San Francisco Fed district: “In general, employment has recovered faster in regions where mobility and commerce restrictions were lifted sooner.”2 Where there are mobility restrictions, public transportation is limited and where there are commerce restrictions, typically we see childcare centers operating below full capacity.
The threat of inflation
Of course, the main concern about an inability to find enough labor is that it could create very substantial wage increases, which in turn can create “sticky” inflation rather than the transitory inflation that the Fed expects. However, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a dramatic, prolonged rise in wage inflation even if there is a labor shortage. It seems that, for now, many employers are looking to utilize one-off sign-on bonuses in order to attract workers. For example, as the Minneapolis Fed noted, “Multiple contacts mentioned growing prevalence of sign-on bonuses, which helped attract candidates without raising long-term salary commitments.”2  Similarly, we heard from the Philadelphia Fed that “signing bonuses — a common practice in the warehouse sector — were reported by several contacts in the hospitality sector ...”2  Certainly some employers are raising wages, but thus far they appear to be relatively modest in general.
Companies are also considering other ways to keep a lid on labor costs. For example, the Cleveland Fed reports, “In some cases, contacts indicated that they were planning to adopt more technology (in lieu of more employees) to keep up with demand.”2 The Atlanta Fed reported that “some firms plan to utilize full-time remote positions to attract and retain workers for hard-to-fill positions.”2
So where do we go from here?
To me, it’s clear that the US economy will accelerate, which should mean swifter employment growth. I expect a rise in wages along with it, but no dramatic wage increases given that any labor shortage should be short-lived. After all, most schools will re-open for in person learning by September, and daycare centers will also be re-opening and ramping up capacity. And if more employees enter the labor market when schools go in person and daycare centers and public transportation resume operations at full capacity, then any wage pressures would ease. Public transportation schedules are also likely to return to normal in coming months, adding to the available pool of labor.  And those holdouts because of health safety concerns are likely to start returning to the labor force as vaccination rates go up and COVID-19 rates go down. And don’t forget that there will be a significant number of newly minted high school and college grads entering the workforce in the next several months. And since enhanced unemployment benefits are due to expire in September and states have the ability to cancel them earlier (two have already announced the cancellation as of June), that should certainly create a big influx of workers.
And so in my view, we shouldn’t fixate on a single data point or become overly worried by one jobs report. US Treasury Secretary and former Fed Chair Janet Yellen was keenly interested in the labor market — and its potential impact on inflation — but recognized that she needed to look at a mosaic of data to more fully understand it (in fact, she had a 19-point Labor Market Conditions Index created so she could follow a wide variety of metrics over time.) In the spirit of Secretary Yellen, we will be following the many nuances of the US labor market closely. At the same time, we should remind ourselves how committed the Fed is to patient accommodation. All in all, I expect 2021 to be a good year for the economy, the labor market and for investors who are willing to remain invested, and who maintain broad diversification and a longer time horizon.

The differences between Republicans and Democrats can often be obvious when it comes to many policy issues, but one that often blurs the lines is our nation’s infrastructure.
Whether on the campaign trail or in town halls or committee hearings, Republicans and Democrats appear united on the pressing need for bipartisan solutions to provide adequate funding for and investments in surface transportation and broad infrastructure. Both parties view it as a political “winner” that helps spur job and economic growth, supports businesses and unions, eases an everyday life issue (who doesn’t want to spend less time in a traffic jam?), and increases the international competitiveness of the United States.
President Joe Biden campaigned on the importance of passing a $2 trillion comprehensive infrastructure package, calling it a “critical need to invest in modern and sustainable American infrastructure.” But Biden’s Build Back Better plan is more than just infrastructure. It involves investments in a host of other sectors, including manufacturing and supply chains, caregiving, diversity, and education, to name a few.

Key takeaways
Regulatory fears cast a shadow
Chinese tech stocks have pulled back due to growing concerns about regulatory developments.
Guidelines may strengthen innovation
We believe recent antitrust regulatory interventions and guidelines will ultimately strengthen leading Chinese innovators by encouraging more rational competitive behavior.

It is our strong conviction that recent regulatory intrusions in Chinese internet reflect appropriate concerns about the potential for monopolistic abuse and unique risks to financial stability. We believe these actions will strengthen leading Chinese tech innovators and their ecosystems by encouraging entrepreneurial innovation. And we also expect such prudential regulation to embellish economic development in this period of Chinese economic renaissance. By no means, in our view, do these regulatory interventions mean that China wants to neglect innovation or impose greater state control (or even ownership of) the country’s technology giants. 

In regulating tech, China enjoys three advantages

China has achieved a scale and diversity in its internet industry that rivals and, in some areas, surpasses the West. This gives China plentiful experience to implement reforms, at scale.
Over the last five years, Chinese authorities have shown the capacity to move faster than their Western counterparts. This period has seen crackdowns on online gambling, curbs on unverified search results on topics such as medical advice, and push back on “opt-out” practices in the travel industry that billed unaware consumers for services they did not need. Recent steps, such as the recognition of asymmetric risk-reward within fintech credit, as well as the attention on predatory pricing and exclusivity practices, continue what has been China’s impressive and consistent report card in regulating tech. We believe that this stands out versus the hesitant steps of Western governments. 
We contend that Chinese internet has always been more diffused and competitive than its Western counterpart. In the last three years we have seen behemoths Alibaba and Tencent yield meaningful ground to new competitors in e-commerce market share and consumer time share, respectively. (As of March 31, 2021, Alibaba and Tencent represented 2.80% and 6.45% of total net assets in Invesco Developing Markets Fund, respectively.)
In our view, this fertility of entrepreneurial energy, and creative challenge to the leaders, should ensure that regulation, while re-arranging the cards, will not damage innovation and progress. 

What lies ahead?
The questions that face regulators today comprise the re-definition of certain fundamental boundaries. When does an internet ecosystem step over the line from being a catalyst for innovation and empowerment to a tool of extraction and exploitation? When does the ownership of risk and reward become unfair between the parties to an internet arrangement?  When do inventors become rent-seekers? And when do disruptors become the new establishment? 
We see the future through the following lenses. 

Ecosystem does not mean exploitation: Only regulation can overcome the almost irresistible economic temptation among internet platforms to become rent-seeking gatekeepers of their walled gardens. App stores charge exorbitant fees, social networks prevent cross-linking, online platforms create frictions in user interfaces to favor specific payment methods. Exclusionary practices abound, preventing merchants from operating across platforms. Regulatory action against these practices is long overdue, and we think can lead to good, by enabling platforms to retain and build upon their well-earned strengths, while removing their many appropriations.
Extraction differs from Facilitation: Internet platforms must be incented to earn their keep. Arbitrary rises in extractive monetization measures should see restraint. We think commissions, operating fees and take rates fall in this category. Conversely, facilitation should continue to thrive. Alongside rising digitalization across the Chinese economy, we note that advertising in China is about half as large a share of its retail sales as in the US. Here, we are optimists. 
Financial innovation, but not at the cost of systemic stability. Fintech’s desire to operate in an unregulated zone separated from traditional financial institutions was always a step too far. It ought to be far more beneficial to society when traditional financial institutions also have incentives to digitalize, and when artificial barriers around access to consumer data, traffic, and payment methods (such as non-compatible QR codes) are removed. Regulatory reform here is set to remove moral hazard from the system, forcing skin in the game for all players.
Data belongs to no one, and everyone. Data is a thorny issue that steps on debates around privacy and the role of the State. Early wins might center around combining online data with offline – building a credit file on consumers of far-reaching granularity and accuracy – and making this framework available to all innovators. Merchants might gain from the removal of arbitrary traffic re-direction practices that sometimes bypass underlying data algorithms and allow platforms to favor one over the other. The consolidation of data and its availability to new platforms should spur innovation.

We have been investors in the China internet space for more than a decade and a half. Amid the continuing entrepreneurial and regulatory innovation in China, we see the future as an exploration of new options, and differ from the current market discomfort around regulatory moves in Chinese tech. Indeed, we believe that heightened regulation in China may counterintuitively function to moderate unsustainable competition and accompanying losses – leading to better investment outcomes.

Foster resilience and energy in high-stress environments
Everything you hope to achieve, personally and professionally, likely presumes you have the energy to accomplish it. The more stressful the environment — like today — the more rapidly energy will likely dissipate, potentially resulting in lost focus, passion, perspective, and eventually, even hope.
To address this challenge, Invesco Global Consulting developed ""What Matters Most Right Now: Energy Management for High Performance."" This program discusses:
1. Four tanks from which people derive energy and resilience: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual

Physical — Establish a strong physical foundation
Mental — Recharge and reset your focus
Emotional — Maintain emotional equilibrium during times of crisis
Spiritual — Build a life with purpose

2. Activities, actions, and tactics designed to help keep each of those four tanks full
To help mitigate being stressed and overwhelmed, there are two generally options: decrease demand or increase capacity. In times of crisis, it is often difficult to impact the amount of demand on your system. However, there are things that you might consider instituting in your day-to-day life to help build capacity.
3. A practical guide for moving from ""discipline"" to ""habit"" in any endeavor
To sustain any change long-term, you should strive to move from ""discipline"" to ""habit."" The key is consistency; the more complex the activity, the more time it takes before it becomes a habit.

We know emotion often drives investor behavior. Humans often make decisions emotionally and backfill with facts, and if investors are fearful, they’re likely not able to “hear” those facts. We believe financial professionals need to work to understand their clients’ emotional reactions to be most helpful.
Based on an ongoing study of unique and proprietary research including analysis from the 2008 recession, Invesco Global Consulting developed ""What Matters Most Right Now: The Resilient Advisor."" In this module of the ""What Matters Most Right Now"" program, we’ll share reminders on ways financial professionals can maintain resiliency, identify ways top performers respond in uncertain times, and discuss ways to use research-based communications designed to effectively engage their clients.
The “right” approach to working with clients in uncertain times
Right themselves: Maintain resiliency by taking care of themselves first.

Specific actions that can be taken in order to maintain resilience in stressful markets

Right their focus: Focus on what they can control.

Becoming a “top performer” in uncertain markets by focusing on things they can control.

Tim Benzel
Senior Portfolio Manager


Largely a result of economic optimism, government bond yields rose globally during the first quarter of 2021 as investors began to price in higher levels of economic growth and inflation in the post-pandemic world. Here in the US, another large fiscal stimulus package was signed into law, signs are emerging that there is large pent-up demand for various services, and the employment picture has improved.
These factors drove the yield on the closely watched 10-year Treasury Note to 1.74%, up from 0.91% to start the year. 30-year Treasury yields moved higher by 0.77% to end the quarter at 2.41%. Importantly, short-term rates, which are closely tied to Federal Reserve policy, were quite steady. Two-year US Treasury yields moved up just 0.04% to 0.16%.
At its most recent policy meeting in March, the Federal Reserve left its expectation for the Fed Funds Rate unchanged for the next several years. This signals to investors that despite an improving economy, the Committee expects to keep the Fed Funds Rate at the zero bound and let the economy “run hot.” It also indicates that the Fed is not overly concerned about future levels of inflation running well above the targeted 2% average level. This lack of concern with future inflation triggered a rise in intermediate- and longer-term bond yields. As inflation erodes the value of future interest payments, investors often push bond yields higher when they fear inflation is set to pick up. With the Fed’s firm commitment to easy monetary policies, investors were quick to price in higher inflation.

Key takeaways
Over the course of history, humans have become richer
One of the first things people do with more money is spend it on higher-quality food.
Quality may now supersede price in consumers’ decisions about what to eat
This structural change in consumer preferences has created growth opportunities for a number of companies.
We see several interesting growth opportunities
Farmed fish, innovative cooking technologies, and premium mixers are just a few areas we’re watching.

As part of our investment approach, we look for opportunity that arises from the structural changes going on in the world. One of the most powerful, consistent, and underappreciated changes of the past several decades is that quite simply, people around the world have gotten a lot richer.1 And history has shown that as people get richer, one of the first things they do is to spend up on better-quality, more nutritious foods for themselves and their families. This simple fact has a host of investment implications across the developed and emerging worlds. In emerging markets, the rise out of subsistence living for billions of people has provided the discretionary income to be more selective about what they eat. In developed markets, consumers are directing more of their food dollars to things that not only taste good, but which are also nutritious and free of harmful additives. We believe this massive structural change in consumer preferences has created very tasty growth opportunities for a number of companies.
Growth opportunity #1: Consumption of farmed fish may continue to rise
If you talk to a random sample of people around the world, they’d probably tell you that overall, they’re eating a lot more fish than they have in decades past. The numbers back this up. In the 1960s, the average person ate just 21.8 pounds of fish per year, according to a United Nations report.2 50 years later, the level of fish consumption had doubled to more than 44 pounds.2 However, this huge increase creates major concerns about sustainability and overfishing of the world’s oceans. Indeed, over the past several years, the growth rate of the world’s wild catch has plateaued, 2 leaving consumers searching for other ways to satiate their appetite for fish.

Since the 1960s, the proportion of the global fish catch originating from fish farms has expanded from practically nothing to exceeding the total volume of fish caught in the wild in recent years.2 The world’s largest supplier of farmed salmon, a fish that is nutritious but notoriously hard to farm, is a company called Mowi. Based in Norway, a country whose fjords provide the perfect growing conditions for this fickle fish, Mowi sells more than 440,000 tons of salmon to more than 70 markets around the globe.3 The company has been a major advocate of sustainable approaches and a developer of innovative techniques in the field of fish farming. In an era when there are major concerns about feeding the world’s growing population and overfishing of the world’s oceans, we expect a continuing tailwind for this farmer.

Shrimp is the most popular fish consumed around the world, but salmon actually overtook canned tuna to take second place in the US in 2018.4 Salmon is popular globally as well. It is hard to believe before the 1980s there was no salmon sushi in Japan, but after a successful push by Norwegian salmon producers to sell their farmed salmon in Japan, salmon sushi and sashimi are now available everywhere. Salmon is both nutritious and tasty, and it’s been described as a “gateway fish.” This helped Japan’s sushi gain popularity globally.

As people eat more fish, they also want a way to verify its quality and origins. Seafood fraud is a major problem across the food industry. A recent study from Oceana, a conservation group, showed that 21% of seafood samples they tested from restaurants, markets, and stores were something other than what the label said.5 The most common form of fraud sees an expensive fish, such as sea bass, replaced by a visually similar but much cheaper fish like giant perch or Nile tilapia. This is where the Luxembourg-based Eurofins Scientific comes in. The company has a broad-based diagnostics and testing business; one of its services is a DNA-based technology that distribution companies can use to identify fish samples. A label can then be used to prove that a premium fish is fresh and exactly what it is supposed to be. As a result, suppliers, restaurants, and consumers don’t have to worry that a lower-quality substitute is pretending to be something it’s not.

Growth opportunity #2: Higher-quality ingredients are in demand

Shake Shack is a chain of restaurants that has capitalized on consumers’ appetite for a “better burger.” The beef they use is free of antibiotics and hormones, their custards are flavored with real sugar, and even the bacon that tops their famous Smokeshack burger is made without MSG or nitrites. I believe this attention to quality ingredients makes a real difference to the taste of Shake Shack’s food, and people have demonstrated they are willing to pay a premium price for a more premium experience than what the biggest names in fast foods offer.
Since its origin 20 years ago as a single hot dog cart in New York’s Madison Square Park, the chain has grown to encompass more than 250 locations all around the world.6 Whether in downtown New York or in the Tokyo airport, long lines of customers appear to be a regular sight outside of Shake Shack locations, and we think they can continue their growth while maintaining their distinction from the more common burger establishments that seem to be on every corner.
The global appeal of burgers shows that people may have the same tastes worldwide, even if they historically have had very different cuisines. And it is not surprising that burger restaurants are where innovations like plant-based meat have seen much success. There are many different companies making meat from non-animal sources, and Novozymes can help this process to get the right texture and taste by providing specialized enzymes.
Growth opportunity #3: The at-home cocktail trend may boost the appeal of premium mixers

Luxury liquor is one of the fastest-growing segments of the alcoholic beverage industry, growing at a 9.2% annual rate over the past five years.7 When it comes to consuming these premium spirits, I believe customers have increasingly demanded a premium mixer to go with them. This trend has been a strong tailwind for Fevertree, a British company that makes high-quality seltzers, tonics, and sodas. Their beverages come in smaller cans and bottles that are pre-measured to be the ideal size to make a premium mixed drink. This market is one of very few where the luxury brand actually has a higher market share than competing non-luxury brands. For many people, paying a small premium for a quality tonic to mix with their gin is the type of affordable luxury that can become a regular part of their lives. The pandemic has increased the consumption of at-home cocktails,8 and we expect it to continue for some time to come.

Growth opportunity #4: Cooking technology innovations can transform the foodservice industry

During this pandemic, a French neighbor of mine began baking at home and started a service delivering hot-out-of-the-oven French baguettes. It reminded me that there is no better comfort food than freshly baked bread, but not everyone has the luxury of an unemployed French neighbor, and neighborhood bakeries have shut down in many cases. Rheon Automatic manufactures automatic bread machines. I can see a future where every corner deli has the equipment needed to make fresh bread daily for everyone to enjoy.

Innovation in cooking technology allows restaurants, cafeterias, caterers, and schools to cook healthy food quickly, efficiently, and in small spaces. Rational has a line of combination ovens that can roast, poach, bake, steam, and more. The appliance is programmable, so you can cook without constantly watching the food, and repeat the same process accurately each time. Rational recently came out with a new appliance, the iVario, that can shallow-fry, deep-fry, pressure cook, and more, in a shorter time, using less energy.

The bottom line: Consumers may be willing to pay for premium quality

Of course, higher-quality food, of course, often comes at a premium price, but consumers have made it clear they’re willing to pay more to achieve a better-quality experience, in my view. That willingness may also provide some protection from the impact of competitive pricing for these companies, an important characteristic for the types of long-term investments we’re interested in.

As investors, we are always looking for trends that can drive sustainable, long-term growth for companies. We believe the trend of consumers directing a larger portion of their food budget toward higher-quality — and higher-margin — options is here to stay.
As of March 30, 2021, Invesco Global Opportunities Fund had 1.05% of assets invested in Mowi ASA, 2.03% in Eurofins Scientific, 1.20% in Shake Shack, 0.34% in Novozymes, 0.63% in FeverTree Drinks, 0.66% in Rational, and 0.11% in Rheon Automatic Machinery.

Key takeaways
Flexibility and control
Multi-asset strategies offer the flexibility to shift away from market-driven performance to a more absolute return option.
Consistent returns
A balanced-risk allocation strategy optimizes allocations across equity, fixed income, and commodities with the goal of delivering more consistent returns across the full economic cycle.
Greater liquidity
Highly liquid multi-asset strategies can help investors find liquidity in market downturns by offering steadier return streams without exposure to equity markets.

While markets have started to gain ground after sharp drops earlier in 2020, it remains uncertain what lies ahead as the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold. At this time of market disruption and volatility, it’s worth investigating multi-asset risk mitigation strategies.
COVID-19 market shocks
The world quickly transformed this year, as the novel coronavirus created wide-scale turmoil in the world and in the financial markets. Asian equity markets were the first to be impacted before panic quickly spread westward.
During the market sell-off in late February and March, long equity, credit, and emerging market debt exposure fell along with broader market declines. On the other hand, strategies involving interest rates, safe haven currencies, short commodities, and relative equity pairs (such as large cap versus small cap, and staples versus discretionary) contributed positively to portfolios.
Be prepared with a risk strategy
The crisis has served as a reminder to be prepared for a broad range of investment scenarios. Investors overexposed to risk — as well as those who played it safe when markets began to rebound — likely suffered more disappointing relative portfolio performance than those who maintained more optimized risk and reward exposures.
Multi-asset strategies and risk mitigation
Multi-asset strategies offer the flexibility to shift away from specific market-driven performance to a more absolute return option that offers greater control over risk exposure. These strategies offer a way to increase portfolio risk efficiency with greater liquidity and cost efficiency compared to hedge fund, private equity and venture capital investments.

Key takeaways
Tech stocks under pressure
Thus far, the tech sector has been the second-worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 Index in 2021.
Reasons for tech optimism
However, I believe that any significant tech sell-offs could represent a buying opportunity for long-term investors.
A long-term force
Technology offers solutions for today’s problems and sparks creative disruption across industries

Technology stocks have been under pressure this year — thus far, the tech sector has been the second-worst-performing sector in the S&P 500 Index in 2021.1 However, while I don’t expect tech stocks to lead the market in performance very soon, I think there are some compelling reasons for investors with a long time horizon to treat any significant tech sell-offs as buying opportunities.
What has happened to tech this year?

Tech’s underperformance started with the announcement last November that highly effective vaccines had been developed to protect against COVID-19. This was a “game changer” — a critical development that caused the stock market to anticipate a strong economic recovery, which meant cyclicals started to outperform more defensive areas of the stock market such as technology.
Then in the first quarter of this year, the 10-year US Treasury yield rose rapidly, most negatively impacting, higher valuation equities such as tech stocks.

In addition, there are also concerns that some tech companies will come under heavier governmental regulation.

Reasons for tech optimism

So why do I believe that any significant tech sell-offs would represent a buying opportunity for long-term investors?
Earnings and revenues are attractive for technology. First-quarter earnings season is almost over (as of May 21, 95% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index reported earnings for the first quarter) and the tech sector delivered a strong performance.2 Tech was one of two sectors that had the highest percentage of companies that reported earnings above estimates — a whopping 94%.2 And it’s not just earnings — tech had the highest percentage of companies reporting revenue above estimates as well at 94% (followed by communication services, which includes a number of stocks formerly classified as part of the tech sector at 88%).2 And tech is one of the sectors that reported the largest positive spread between actual revenues and estimated revenues.2 And the tech sector is reporting the highest year-over-year revenue growth of all 11 sectors at 21.5%, with four of the six industries in tech having reported growth above 15%.2 These results certainly help to justify current valuations, which are on the rich side but remain well below valuations during the tech bubble.

The future also looks attractive for tech. Estimates for calendar year 2022 indicate that the tech sector is expected to have the fourth-highest revenue growth of any sector.2 Another important point to make is that the tech sector has the greatest non-US revenue exposure of any sector in the S&P 500 Index — 57% of tech companies’ revenues are derived from outside the US.2 Given that we expect economies outside the US to follow the US into a stronger recovery as economies re-open, the tech sector’s strong revenue and earnings may have longer legs.

Post-pandemic themes have staying power. The pandemic resulted in people spending virtually all their time at home — working from home, exercising from home, being entertained from home, and shopping from home. While economies are re-opening and people are no longer at home full-time, some habits have developed that are likely to continue.

For example, e-commerce sales have dropped recently as COVID-19 infections have fallen and people have spent less time sequestered at home; however I expect they will remain a very substantial portion of overall retail sales — and that portion will soon resume its rise as a percentage of overall retail sales. Consumers recognize the convenience of shopping online, especially as Internet retailers continue to improve delivery times. While some people are likely to go back to the gym, a significant portion of consumers will continue to exercise from home at least part of the time given all the products that have been developed to enable workouts from home.

Fintech is another theme that gathered steam during the pandemic as more transactions became electronic. For example, while consumers are now spending more time dining and shopping in person, they are less likely to carry cash than they were prior to the pandemic. I expect greater reliance on electronic forms of payment to continue.

Finally, many employees are not planning to return to an office full time. Many expect to now be “hybrid” — working part of the time from home and part of the time in the office. Companies will need to continue to spend on technology in order to enable employees to work from home at least part-time. And that brings me to my next point …

Corporate spending on technology is expected to accelerate. Companies in general have higher levels of cash that they can deploy on tech spending. They reduced their tech spending in 2020, and therefore need to spend more in 2021 in order to keep up. Global information technology spending is expected to rise 8.4% in 2021, and it’s projected that the IT spending focus for 2021 will be on revenue growth.3

In addition, technology may offer solutions to the problems that many companies are facing today. The hacking of the Colonial Pipeline just a few weeks ago underscored the vulnerability of so many private entities that are charged with protecting themselves from cyberattacks. I would expect to see more spending on cybersecurity — and more innovation to meet these challenges. Similarly, some companies in certain industries are finding it difficult to source qualified employees, and are turning to technology for the solution. As I mentioned in a previous blog, the Cleveland Fed reported in the most recent Federal Reserve Beige Book, “In some cases, contacts indicated that they were planning to adopt more technology (in lieu of more employees) to keep up with demand.”4

Personal spending on technology may also accelerate. There are elevated household savings levels in a number of countries, and there is the potential for it to be spent at least partially on personal technology — for example, the newest smartphone or tablet.

Conclusion

In short, despite the shorter-term headwinds, technology is a long-term force that offers solutions for today’s problems and sparks creative disruption across industries. I believe it’s an exciting time to be a global technology investor, with dips in valuations rendering attractive entry points.

Celebrate education savings with Invesco

Key takeaways
National 529 Day was created to bring awareness to 529 plans
Over 50% of US families don’t know about or use this effective education savings tool.
A 529 plan is a type of education savings plan that helps families save for education
529 plans offer a unique combination of convenience, control, and tax benefits to maximize savings.

May 29 marks another year of National 529 Day, a holiday created to raise awareness of 529 college savings plans. While many families know that it’s important to save for an education, more than half of families around the US don’t know about or use this effective education savings tool. Instead, many families rely on traditional savings accounts, limiting the return opportunity those funds can offer over time. If you’re still unsure if a 529 plan is the right savings tool for you, now’s the perfect time to explore its unique features and how to put it to work for you.
How do 529 plans work?

A 529 plan is an education savings plan that allows families to put money aside to help pay for qualified educational expenses. There are two types of 529 plans:


Prepaid 529 plan: A prepaid 529 plan lets families prepay future college costs (typically at public and in-state schools) at today’s rates.
529 savings plan: A 529 savings plan allows families to contribute money into a savings account that uses various investment options and portfolios to grow the funds over time. Families can then use distributions from the account to pay for education expenses.

When the account owner opens a 529 plan, they name the future student (often their child or grandchild) as the beneficiary. As the account owner, friends, and family contribute to the account over the years, the funds grow tax-free until they’re used to cover the cost of room, board, tuition, and other academic expenses. Unlike some kinds of savings plans, withdrawals for qualified education expenses are free from federal income taxes.1 What’s more, some states offer additional tax deductions or tax credits if you have an in-state 529 plan.
Importantly, the beneficiary doesn’t handle any of the money, giving the account owner full control to make sure earnings are spent as intended. If there is money remaining in the 529 account, or the beneficiary doesn’t use the money, a new beneficiary can be named. The beneficiary can even be changed to the account owner themself.
529 plans: Not just for college

Many people assume that a 529 is only a college savings plan. However, 529 plans can be used for to pay for K-12 tuition and fees, along with other post-high school expenses such as:

Books
School supplies and equipment
Tuition and fees at colleges and vocational/trade schools
Room and board (As eligible)
Expenses for special needs services

For families looking to save for K-12 expenses, it’s even more important to begin saving early so funds can compound as much as possible before they’re used. Remember, it’s never too soon to start saving for the future.
CollegeBound 529 can help you prepare for tomorrow

How can I celebrate 529 Day?
This 529 Day, why not kick off your own savings journey by opening a 529 account, or by lighting the way for a friend or family member? Here are just a few ways to celebrate the occasion.

Key takeaways
A high yield portfolio could add value in a rising rate environment
Historically, high yield has performed well relative to other fixed income alternatives amid rising rates.
High yield could help lower overall portfolio volatility
History shows that high yield has delivered equity-like returns with about half the volatility of equities.
High yield could be a potential risk diversifier
Adding high yield to a fixed income portfolio has tended to dampen overall volatility through its low correlation to more rate-sensitive segments of fixed income.

High fixed income valuations, low yields, tight credit spreads, and concerns of rising government bond yields introduce two important questions for 2021: How do income-focused investors navigate this environment? And how do investors balance maintaining income with the risk of falling bond prices as interest rates rise?
High yield has historically performed well in rising rate environments
The most topical issue in markets today is rising interest rates. Historically, high yield has performed well relative to other fixed income alternatives in rising rate environments. We believe that through careful security selection, a high yield portfolio can even add value in a rising rate environment as issuers improve fundamentally and this improvement is reflected in credit spread tightening. Figure 1 shows high yield’s outperformance relative to other interest rate-sensitive fixed income asset classes during periods of rising rates.

Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
Monitoring the eurozone economy
Europe is emerging from lockdowns, so we will want to gauge its economic progress this month.
Watching the Federal Open Market Committee
I expect fault lines to form within the FOMC as a small but increasingly vocal group pushes to begin tapering soon.
Keeping an eye on inflation
Investors have become more worried about inflation than the pandemic, and inflation expectations matter to the Fed.

May was a long month with lots of data to digest and central bank utterances to decipher. Those who ignored the admonition to “sell in May and go away” were pleased to see the S&P 500 Index close its fourth straight positive month in May.1 But now we need to look ahead to June and what to be following closely:
1. Eurozone Service PMI and retail sales. Europe is emerging from lockdowns, so we will want to gauge its economic progress. It is certainly encouraging to see that the ifo Business Climate Index for Germany rose from 96.6 in April to 99.2 in May — the highest level since May 2019 — as German companies are not only pleased with their current situation but are optimistic about the future.2 In addition, Google mobility data indicates that the eurozone is moving toward a more normal environment with increasing foot traffic at retail stores and restaurants. However, we will want to see confirmation in retail sales as well as the Eurozone Service Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI).
2. May’s US jobs report. The April jobs report was very disappointing — and the whispers suggest that May’s jobs report may be a flop as well. Official expectations are for approximately 600,000 non-farm payrolls created. I suspect it will be lower than that, but not dramatically lower, as the US economy continues to recover and Americans are becoming increasingly willing to return to work. Interestingly, last week the Dallas Fed put out a research note arguing that the labor market is already tighter than most economists believe. Their argument was based on the view that while there are still 8.5 million fewer people employed now than before the pandemic, and the Dallas Fed expects less than half of those to return to employment, with many others having chosen to retire.3 However, I do believe that the majority of the unemployed have not permanently retired and will slowly return to work as the impediments to returning dissipate (childcare options increase, health fears abate as infection rates drop, availability of public transportation improves, and enhanced unemployment benefits end). One important point made in the research note is that wage growth indicates a tighter labor market; in the April jobs report, average hourly earnings rose significantly despite the creation of many lower-paying service sector jobs. And so we will be especially focused on wage growth in this jobs report.
3. Federal Reserve Beige Book. I am a huge fan of the Federal Reserve Beige Book. I think of it as helping to provide color on the data we see — for example, it helped explain the disappointing April jobs report. I suspect the June edition may give us color on both the May jobs report and inflationary pressures, but I am most interested in companies’ capital spending plans. I expect business investment to ramp up this year as the re-opening progresses and business confidence improves; we may get some hints of this in the next Beige Book.
4. June FOMC meeting. In recent weeks, we have heard more “Fedspeak” about the Fed needing to discuss in the near term when to start tapering, although Fed Chair Jay Powell has been more reluctant to even “talk about talking about tapering” right now. The minutes from the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting noted that “A number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the committee’s goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases.” I expect fault lines to form within the FOMC as a small but increasingly vocal group of FOMC members push for the Fed to begin tapering soon; we may see signs of that growing internal debate in the minutes.
5. June ECB meeting. European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde has been very dovish in recent months, insisting more stimulus is needed for the eurozone economy and dismissing any talk of tapering in the near term. But headline inflation is on the rise, so it is going to be increasingly difficult for the ECB to ignore at least entertaining the topic of tapering.
6. Consumer inflation expectations. There are several different kinds of inflation expectations: consumer and business expectations, economists’ forecasts, and inflation expectations extrapolated from financial instruments. Consumer inflation expectations used to be of low importance because it has been relatively low for years. However, things have changed in recent months and US consumers seem very aware of high prices now. Last week, the University of Michigan’s consumer inflation expectations reading was released, showing it rose significantly in May. It should matter to the Fed if consumer inflation expectations remain higher — one key rationale for keeping rates low has been that “inflation expectations are well-anchored” — so we will want to follow this closely.
7. Tariffs. Last week the US Commerce Department floated a proposal to double tariffs on lumber from Canada. I had perhaps been too idealistic in assuming that the Biden administration would quickly roll back the tariffs of the Trump administration, recognizing that tariffs are just another tax on American consumers. Not only did that not happen, but we now have a Commerce Department that thinks tariffs may be an appropriate tool in resolving trade disputes. I can only hope that the backlash to this possible action is vocal enough in the coming weeks to deter the Office of the United States Trade Representative from considering tariffs as an appropriate tool for any trade disputes going forward.
8. COVID-19 statistics. COVID-19 has dominated the global economy for more than a year. While many investors have recently become more concerned with inflation than COVID-19, a pandemic resurgence remains a risk. Coronavirus infection rates have risen in countries, such as Taiwan and Malaysia, that have up until now done an excellent job controlling the spread of the virus. This may be due to a slower vaccination rollout; we will want to follow the situation closely, as any country that has had a slower vaccine rollout could be at risk. And while India is finally “bending the curve” when it comes to COVID-19, we have seen an alarming development: Some recovering COVID patients have been afflicted with a “black fungus” — called mucormycosis — with a 50% fatality rate. Last week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson raised alarm bells about a variant of COVID-19 that has proliferated in India and is now quickly spreading in the UK despite a nearly 60% vaccination rate. The UK may postpone re-opening plans as a result. We will want to follow infections and vaccination rates closely.4
9. Geopolitical conflict. It seems that, as the world re-opens, geopolitical crises are becoming more frequent. In recent weeks, a conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has erupted, while the Belarusian government forced the landing of a Ryanair jet in order to arrest a dissident. While a Middle East ceasefire has held for a week, it is fragile. And while European leaders have repudiated Belarus, it is unclear if any additional action will be taken in response to this brazen violation of international laws. It seems we might see more issues — rather than fewer — as economies around the world continue their re-opening.
Conclusion
Ultimately, it’s all about how these data points and speeches impact markets, and they could certainly contribute to volatility. There seems to be an uneasiness growing as investors are increasingly expecting a sell-off this summer. I have no crystal ball, but a correction is always a possibility, especially given the advances the stock market has made in the last year. But in my view, the potential for a correction this summer should not change anything investors with a long time horizon are doing. I believe in staying the course — remaining diversified across asset classes, ensuring adequate exposure to equities — and viewing sell-offs as buying opportunities.

Key takeaways
More companies have turned to convertibles
COVID-19 unleashed a wave of new convertible issuance, as many companies sought capital to shore up balance sheets.
Convertibles have outperformed when rates rise
Investors seeking an alternative to traditional fixed income in a rising rate environment may want to consider convertibles.

Convertibles are a small but important segment of the capital markets. Because the asset class is considerably smaller than the high yield debt market,1 convertibles are often overlooked.  But as investors face the potential for a rising rate environment at some point in the future, we believe it’s time to get acquainted with this asset class, which has a history of outperformance in times of rising rates.
More companies have turned to convertibles for capital
Convertible securities provide an important source of financing for companies. We’ve seen this particularly in the speculative corners of the technology and health care sectors, but they also provide funds for large cap, “mainstream” corporations seeking to finance merger and acquisition activity, repay higher cost debt obligations, or utilize for general corporate purposes. 
The COVID-19 pandemic unleashed a wave of new convertible issuance, as many companies sought capital to shore up balance sheets in the difficult early months of lockdowns and restricted travel. In fact, record-setting issuance of $106 billion in the US convert market last year, in addition to the strong performance of the asset class, propelled the size of the asset class from roughly $200 billion in market value at the end of 2018 to a more recent $361 billion, according to data from Bank of America.2
Companies that had not previously accessed the convertibles market in the past came to the market in 2020, many from consumer-focused areas in the travel, entertainment, and retail industries. New issuance in the market has continued into 2021, with a mix of more traditional health care and technology companies, along with additional newcomers to the asset class. Indeed, over the past few months, companies such as Viacom, TripAdvisor, Ford Motor, Airbnb, Spotify and Groupon among others have issued converts.3 Despite the convertible universe’s relatively small size, convertibles are very much a widely utilized and investible asset class.
Why invest in convertibles?
For one thing, the unique structure of convertibles combines equity and bond features, enabling them to provide a measure of risk mitigation in equity-oriented portfolios due to their bond-like regular coupons and stated maturities as well as their capital structure seniority relative to equities.
For bond-focused portfolios, converts can provide price appreciation through their embedded equity call options. Furthermore, according to data from Bank of America, convertibles have posted a long-term cumulative return well in excess of high yield bonds as well as investment-grade corporate and government bonds.4
Another important attribute of converts has been their performance during periods of rising interest rates. In fact, the table below shows that in each of the last 13 periods of rising interest rates in the US going back to 1989-1990, the performance of convertibles, as measured by the ICE BofA US Convertible Index, has exceeded that of US government bonds (as measured by the Bloomberg Barclays US Government/Credit Index). Converts also outpaced the returns of the high yield market in a majority of those timeframes, as measured by the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate High Yield Index, and they even outperformed the S&P 500 Index during several of those periods.

Key takeaways
Investors are worried about inflation
An outsized jobs report stoked fears that the economy may overheat.
I expect inflation to dissipate
My outlook is for near-term inflation that supports corporate earnings but isn’t strong enough over time to trigger Federal Reserve tightening.

It wasn’t lost on me that Thursday’s outsized ADP jobs report supports my view that investors tend to worry too much. Wasn’t it just a month ago that investors were fretting over an astonishingly weak nonfarm payrolls report? The narrative built from the April payrolls report was that the government’s fiscal largesse was enough to keep American workers from returning to the labor force. If there wasn’t to be enough workers to produce the goods to match the ever-growing demand, then a menacing price spiral would be upon us. Never mind that the payrolls report is notorious for undercounting workers out of a recession or that the extended unemployment benefits were to expire in early September. Anyway, as my daughter might say, that was so one month ago. According to ADP’s report on Thursday, nearly 1 million Americans “got off the couch” in May and returned to work.1 Now, we’re being told that the job market may be too strong and that the economy could be at risk of overheating. I understand completely if you’re confused.
The economy is working through dislocations
I interpret the torrent of economic data releases as reflective of an economy that is working through severe dislocations. In my world, an economy adding 1 million jobs in May 2021 after shedding 19 million jobs in April 2020 is not cause for concern.2 Further, businesses appear to be not only looking to rehire to match the growing demand, but are also investing to rebuild inventories and improve productive capabilities, both of which should suppress inflation concerns. Capital expenditures are back to pre-pandemic levels and strong enough to be deemed “an underappreciated star performer” by one industry veteran.3 Wednesday’s Institute for Supply Management readings showed inventories rising while the regional reports even suggested some over-ordering.4 As an example, for all the hand wringing about the dearth of computer chips, the semiconductor industry is on track to spend $45 billion on new equipment over the next 12 months.5 In fact, they’re spending at a pace to meet demand multiple quarters from now. If inflation is caused by, as Milton Friedman says, “too much money chasing after too few goods” then let’s take solace in the business response to the economic reopening.
All of this is not to say that there won’t be inflation fears in the markets in the coming weeks. There may be. That’s to be expected in an economy that is reopening rapidly while still being challenged by the previously Draconian cuts by businesses to workforces and to inventories. That is precisely why, I, for one, am encouraged by the ADP report as well as by the other economic data releases mentioned above. As the economic dislocations recede, so too should the inflation concerns.
What’s the bond market telling us?
Don’t just take it from me. Take it from the bond market. Much has been made about the 1-year inflation breakeven (the difference between the nominal yield of the 1-year US Treasury and the yield of the 1-year Treasury Inflation Protected Security) being at 3.3%, well above the US Federal Reserve’s perceived “comfort zone”.6 More importantly however is that the 3-year and 5-year breakevens are well below 3%, suggesting the bond market also believes that inflation pressures will be temporary.7

Key takeaways
US jobs fell somewhat short of expectations
I think of this as a “Goldilocks” type of jobs report: not too hot and not too cold.
Eurozone data shows strong economic growth is emerging
Purchasing Managers’ Indexes show that the eurozone is following in the footsteps of the US.
Federal Reserve plans to sell certain bond assets
The Fed decided to begin selling off the asset portfolio of one of its emergency lending facilities, but I view this as a non-event.

Last week I laid out a few things to watch in June. Well, several of the reports that I highlighted were released in the last week. Here are some key takeaways: 
May’s US jobs report: Keeping an eye on wage growth
As I suspected, non-farm payrolls growth fell short of expectations, but only modestly. I think of this as a “Goldilocks” type of jobs report: not too hot and not too cold. There were 559,000 jobs created in May — well below the “hot” job creation we saw in March, when 785,000 jobs were added to the economy, but well above the “cold” job creation in April, when only 278,000 jobs were added to the economy.1 The 5.8% unemployment rate for May1 beat expectations, which was positive.
However, one area of concern is wage growth. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% from April to May, on the heels of a similar month-over-month rise from March to April.1 This makes sense — even though job creation was concentrated in the typically lower-paying leisure and hospitality sectors of the economy — because there is a high level of job openings in the United States. I am not too concerned about this significant rise in average hourly earnings given that I think it is relatively short-term in nature. Employers are clearly having difficulty sourcing employees and are therefore having to pay more for them, but I believe that labor shortage is temporary. I expect September will be the first month in which we see a return to a more normal environment for labor given that enhanced unemployment benefits will expire by then (for some states, they will expire even sooner)2 and that is when schools are back in session in person, which solves most people’s childcare issues. I also assume that by then, public transportation schedules may have largely returned to normal, and fears of COVID-19 infections will have subsided further as vaccine rates continue to rise and COVID-19 cases continue to fall.
Federal Reserve Beige Book: The economy is improving
The main takeaways from the Beige Book are no surprise — it’s what we have been hearing for several months now:

The economy is improving moderately, and is expected to accelerate further. The outlook is getting brighter:

“All contacts were optimistic for the rest of 2021 and some revised their forecasts up.
Contacts were optimistic that consumer spending would continue to improve in the coming months thanks to growing vaccination numbers and easing of government-mandated restrictions.
Bankers, accountants, and bankruptcy attorneys continued to report that relatively few problems with bad debt had emerged.
Survivors in the retail and restaurant sectors are reporting strong sales and profits even against 2019 levels. Rising vaccination rates and an anticipated return to “normal” are feeding positive expectations for the remainder of the year”.3

As a result of the improving outlook, businesses may want to hire more employees:

“Staffing levels increased at a relatively steady pace, with two-thirds of Districts reporting modest employment growth over the reporting period and the remainder indicating employment gains were moderate.
Manufacturers described ambitious hiring goals: one planned to hire 10,000 workers and another had open positions equal to more than 10 percent of total staff.
Recent hiring and near-term hiring expectations improved for firms of all sizes; however, large firms reported significantly stronger hiring tendencies”.3
However, greater demand for labor and lower supply is creating wage pressure, although it has been generally temperate thus far:
“Overall wage growth was moderate, and a growing number of firms offered signing bonuses and increased starting wages to attract and retain workers. Contacts expected that labor demand will remain strong, but supply constrained, in the months ahead.
Wage pressures were moderate overall. Wage growth among the large majority of contacts remained below 3 percent on an annualized basis.
Wages continued to rise modestly. The percentage of nonmanufacturing firms reporting higher wage and benefit costs per employee edged above one-third, while the share reporting lower wages remained very low. Prior to the pandemic, the share of firms reporting compensation increases averaged well over one-third. Across all sectors, firms continued to report raising wages and offering signing bonuses, retention bonuses, and referral bonuses to compete for scarce labor resources.
Wage pressure picked up from April through mid-May, and upward pressure was most notable among low- skilled positions. Within this segment, reports of wage increases were more widespread with referral and signing bonuses becoming increasingly more common.
One (staffing) firm reported sharply higher pay rates for selected positions and said that the higher rates reflected a combination of labor scarcity and growing business confidence.”3
However, most of the reasons for labor scarcity are temporary:
“Among the barriers to labor supply, firms cited generous unemployment benefits, childcare responsibilities, and safety concerns.
Many business contacts ranked staffing as a top business concern, especially at the lower end of the wage spectrum, and attributed this to a combination of workers’ health concerns, child-care constraints, and generous unemployment benefits.
Many employers continued to state that expanded unemployment insurance benefits and stimulus payments were keeping would-be workers on the sidelines; others indicated that childcare, transportation issues, and the inability to guarantee hours were key factors in preventing potential workers from seeking employment.
Employers, temp agencies, and workforce development organizations pointed to a number of factors limiting labor supply, including health safety concerns, childcare challenges, cutbacks in public transportation schedules, job search fatigue, and financial support from the government.”3
Labor scarcity isn’t the only issue affecting employers. The other significant headwind is supply chain disruptions:
“Contacts cited two main limits to growth: labor scarcity and supply chain issues.
Contacts reported that continuing supply chain disruptions intensified cost pressures.
Contacts continued to note severe supply chain disruptions impacting most sectors of the economy. Microchip shortages continued to limit current and future production plans, and container shortages continued to disrupt logistics.”3
We will of course follow this situation closely, but I must note that if you told me a year ago that we would have strong economic re-openings and increasing consumer and business optimism — but also suffer from labor shortages and supply chain disruptions — I would have been elated. All in all, these are pretty good problems to have, especially since I expect labor shortages to be relatively temporary for the most part.
I was also hoping that the Beige Book would report widespread capex spending plans from businesses. That didn’t happen, but we did hear from the Chicago Fed, which indicated that such spending has been moderate in its District, and helped illuminate why capex spending hasn’t been more robust:
“Business spending increased moderately in April and early May. Capital expenditures were up moderately, and contacts expected a moderate increase over the next twelve months. Several contacts said that long wait times for equipment were holding back spending”.3
I believe supply chain issues are the key reason that business spending has been tempered. Once those problems have been worked out, I expect increased capex spending in the US.
Eurozone data: Strong economic growth is emerging
Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMI) show that the eurozone is following in the footsteps of the US with strong economic growth. Composite PMI for the eurozone clocked in at 57.1, and manufacturing PMI was a very strong 63.1.4 As Chris Williamson, economist at IHS Markit, explained, “Eurozone manufacturing continues to grow at a rate unprecedented in almost 24 years of survey history, the PMI breaking new records for a third month in a row. Surging output growth adds to signs that the economy is rebounding strongly in the second quarter.”4
It wasn’t just the manufacturing sector; the service sector is also on the rise with a PMI of 55.2, a sign of the robust economic re-opening starting in the eurozone.5 Williamson described it best: “The eurozone’s vast service sector sprang back into life in May, commencing a solid recovery that looks likely to be sustained throughout the summer.” Individual country PMIs were impressive, with some countries’ manufacturing PMIs hitting multi-year highs. Spain gets honorable mention for its services sector, as its services PMI is at the same level as its manufacturing PMI (59.4).5 (In addition to the eurozone figures, we got PMIs for the United Kingdom, which were very impressive: 65.6 for manufacturing and 62.9 for services.6)
Now, this is not an entirely rosy picture. As with the US, there are supply constraints and difficulty finding enough employees: “A growing area of concern is capacity constraints, both in terms of supplier shortages and difficulties taking on new staff to meet the recent surge in demand. This is leading to a spike in price pressures, which should ease as supply conditions improve, but may remain an area of concern for some months, especially if labor shortages feed through to higher wages.”5 As with the US, I would expect these challenges to be temporary, but we will need to follow the situation closely.
All in all, it is shaping up to be a strong second quarter in Europe – and an even stronger third quarter as the re-opening progresses.
Eurozone retail sales: April figures fell more than expected
Retail sales for April were disappointing, falling more than expected. Clearly the lockdowns took a very substantial toll. This is not dissimilar to what we saw in Japan, where April retail sales fell 4.5% due to lockdowns.7 But in my view, this data point is less important than the PMIs given that the April retail sales figure is akin to looking in the rear view mirror, while the PMI data is looking ahead. The good news is that the future looks brighter than the recent past given the dissipation of lockdowns in the eurozone, underscored by the strength indicated in the surveys.
Federal Reserve to sell bond assets
One other thing occurred last week that I think is important to mention. The Fed announced its decision to begin selling off the asset portfolio of one of its emergency lending facilities, the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility. There was concern that this would be viewed negatively by investors, who would interpret this as the start of Fed tapering. However, I view this as a non-event.
Keep in mind this facility was launched in the spring of 2020 as part of the Fed’s “triage” in the face of the pandemic; it was intended to provide liquidity for outstanding corporate bonds. However, this facility saw its asset purchases halted by year end by then-US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. When that happened, the winding down of its portfolio became an inevitable next step, in my estimation. We also have to keep in mind the miniscule size of the facility – think of it as a toy boat and the Fed’s balance sheet as the Queen Mary.  As of April 30, the facility only had $13.8 billion of loans outstanding, including $8.6 billion of corporate bond ETF holdings and $5.2 billion of corporate bonds.8
Looking ahead
In the week ahead, I will be paying closest attention to the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting. As I have said before, the eurozone is following in the footsteps of the United States in terms of a strong economic recovery, and so the ECB’s expected timeline to begin tapering will be on the minds of central bank watchers — especially now that eurozone inflation rose above the ECB’s somewhat confusing below-but-close-to 2% target in May.9 I should stress that I don’t think the ECB feels any pressure to even talk about talking about tapering, but I will be following closely for any insights on the ECB’s current views. We also want to see if the ECB remains concerned about the euro, given that the March ECB minutes indicated concern about euro strength.10
Also worth following: Eurozone ZEW Economic Sentiment, China’s Producer Price Index, US Consumer Price Index, and University of Michigan Inflation Expectations among other data points.
In terms of markets, I believe the environment remains supportive of risk assets, although that doesn’t mean we won’t see heightened volatility as the Fed gets closer to talking about tapering and then ultimately tapering. I believe the growing popularity of dividend-paying stocks globally in recent months is a positive development. They have certainly benefited from the outperformance of cyclicals over defensives, but I believe the main catalyst has been investor expectations that dividend cuts are over now that the economic crisis is over, and perhaps some dividend increases are in the offing given the improving economy and corporate earnings. I remain excited about dividends as a complement to a diversified fixed income portfolio in terms of providing yield for investors, especially given that rates are likely to remain relatively low in many parts of the world for some time to come.

Key takeaways
Our leading economic indicators (LEIS) show that the global expansion is becoming deeper and broader
90% of our country-level LEIS now record an expansion regime, suggesting growth is running above trend and improving across all regions.
The eurozone and UK continue to see the strongest momentum
A strong rebound in demand, coupled with still very low inventories, is leading to a meaningful increase in production expectations.
The macro environment of the past year has largely followed a historical cyclical pattern
Inflation is more likely to increase during a recovery and expansion phase of the cycle, peak during a slowdown, and fall during a contraction.

The global expansion advances further, with strong momentum in Europe and emerging markets. We are not overly concerned about rising inflation at this stage, as long as growth continues to improve.

We have implemented no changes in the Invesco Global Allocation Fund1 and maintain a higher risk posture than our benchmark with an overweight to equities and risky credit at the expense of investment grade and government bonds. We continue to favor equity markets outside the US, and cyclical styles/factors such as value, small-caps, and mid-caps.

Macro update
The latest read of our macro regime framework confirms the cyclical dynamics we have highlighted since the beginning of the year. The global expansion is becoming deeper and broader, with 90% of our country-level leading economic indicators now recording an expansion regime, suggesting growth is running above trend and improving across all regions. As in the past few months, we continue to register the strongest momentum in the eurozone and the UK, where business surveys continue to signal a strong rebound in demand which, coupled with still very low inventories, is leading to a meaningful increase in production expectations. Noticeable increases in consumer sentiment over the past month provide confirmation that the cyclical rebound is spreading across economic sectors as vaccination efforts continue and re-opening gets underway (Figure 1). The outperformance of equity markets over fixed income markets, and cyclical sectors over defensives, suggests global risk appetite and growth expectations continue to improve. 
In our last update, we outlined our perspective on inflation and the expectation for a meaningful increase in year-over-year inflation statistics in the near term due to, among other things, base effects from the recession in Q2 2020. As discussed, we expected these developments to be largely discounted by market consensus, mitigating the potential negative market impact of “high inflation headlines.” Indeed, the reaction of US Treasuries, both nominal and inflation-protected (i.e., TIPS), has been muted despite US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) data releases printing well-above economists’ consensus expectations.2 This market reaction was somewhat surprising, even to us, and may indicate that market participants have already priced in a more meaningful near-term increase in inflation compared to economic forecasters.

May marked the end of the first-quarter earnings season, and midstream results were generally well ahead of consensus expectations with certain companies benefiting materially from market disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri. Despite the strong financial performance and strong year-to-date returns, midstream equities have continued to trade at historically low valuations.
MLP market overview

Midstream MLPs, as measured by the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), ended May up 6.4% on a price basis and up 7.6% after distributions are considered. The AMZ outperformed the S&P 500 Index’s 0.7% total return for the month. The best-performing midstream subsector for May was the Diversified group, while the Propane subsector underperformed, on average.

For the year through May, the AMZ is up 34.6% on a price basis, resulting in a 40.4% total return. This compares to the S&P 500 Index’s 11.9% and 12.6% price and total returns, respectively. The Petroleum Pipeline group has produced the best average total return year-to-date, while the Propane subsector has lagged.

MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-Year US Treasury Bond, narrowed by 43 basis points (bps) over the month, exiting the period at 606 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 692 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 426 bps. The AMZ indicated distribution yield at month-end was 7.7%.

Midstream MLPs and affiliates raised no new marketed equity (common or preferred, excluding at-the-market programs) and $3.5 billion of new debt during the month. MLPs and affiliates announced $0.2 billion of asset acquisitions over the month.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil exited the month at $66.32 per barrel, up 4.3% over the period and 86.9% higher year-over-year. Natural gas prices ended May at $2.99 per million British thermal units (MMbtu), up 1.9% over the month and 61.5% higher than May 2020. Natural gas liquids (NGL) pricing at Mont Belvieu exited the month at $31.67 per barrel, 7.6% higher than the end of April and 85.6% higher than the year-ago period.

News

First-quarter earnings season concludes. First-quarter reporting season concluded in May. Through month-end, 48 midstream entities had announced distributions for the quarter, including 10 distribution increases, one previously announced reduction, and 37 distributions that were unchanged from the previous quarter. Through the end of May, 51 sector participants had reported first-quarter financial results. Operating performance has been, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, coming in 8.2% higher than the market’s consensus estimates and 18.7% higher than the preceding quarter.

DAPL finds a reprieve. Judge James Boasberg of the US District Court of the District of Columbia ruled that the injunction request by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe did not meet the “daunting hurdle” required to shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), while the US Army Corps of Engineers continues its work completing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The EIS is expected to be complete by March 2022.

Colonial Pipeline hack disrupts the eastern seaboard but not the sector. A ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline temporarily disrupted flows of gasoline from the Texas Gulf Coast to the Mid-Atlantic region during May. The pipeline is mostly privately owned, although Shell Midstream Partners (NYSE: SHLX) does hold a 16% stake. Accordingly, the hack carried no meaningful impact on the public midstream sector, though we believe some sector participants may have modestly benefited from increased use of their assets to supplement supply during the pipeline’s outage.

Chart of the month: Midstream valuations
Despite historically strong dividend coverage ratios and free cash flow expectations, midstream equities have been trading at depressed valuation metrics.

The EV-to-EBITDA ratio compares the enterprise value of a company to the EBITDA generated by the company. Enterprise value (EV) is usually defined as the sum of a company’s debt and equity value, less cash balances. EBITDA represents a company’s Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, and represents the cash flows generated by a business irrespective of the company’s underlying capital structure.

The lack of vitality in some traditionally relied-upon assets is a growing concern for institutional investors. Forced to challenge themselves and look for innovative answers to meeting their return needs, investors are examining each piece of their specific investment puzzle and considering how it might be customized to achieve their goals. Customization as a trend has merged, in one notable example, with a redefinition of “barbelling,” a strategy familiar to most investors in which portfolio construction focuses roughly half of allocations on short-term tactical investments and the remaining half on longer-term assets.
With the long end of the reconceived barbell pursuing alpha via illiquidity premiums in private markets, the more immediate and tactical end might be considered the beta portion of a barbell strategy – an area where investors have become comfortable with indexing. With the investing landscape as complex as ever, index investments are considered a fairly reliable source of beta that don’t require much effort and tinkering. As is the case with almost everything else in today’s investment environment, however, the status quo is under scrutiny.
“We’re at a very interesting juncture,” says Vincent de Martel, Head of North America Client Solutions, Invesco. “It has been a one-way street of institutions adding more assets to their index allocations. It’s been the default option for a variety of reasons – cost, transparency, a lack of confidence in active management. But we’re starting to see the limits of the model, and some cracks are starting to appear. One is that investors may not be fully aware of the exposures in each index they invest in. Are the exposures consistent with what they want to achieve on a regional and sector level? As index exposures have taken on a bigger role over time, institutions might want to look closer at what they own and why they own it.”
“We think there will be a shift from first-generation index managers to a newer generation of customized indexes, and we are leading the way.""
- Vicent de Martel, 
 Head of North America Client Solutions, Invesco
Index customization
The secondary effects of volume in indices have also started to pile up against investors. For example, there are trillions upon trillions of dollars in often overlapping brand-name indexes which are reconstituted each year. The trades necessitated by such a rebalancing might go against the best interests of investors, not to mention the issue of closing prices that may be the result of buying or selling pressure from the indexes. The result can leave investors with an index that does not reflect the true economic value of the securities in it.
Combine what de Martel describes as the limits of indexes with the desire on the part of more and more institutional investors to use their assets to pursue specific outcomes – perhaps a certain kind of macro exposure or achieving an environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) goal – and you arrive at demand for customized indexes adapted to the needs of each investor. It’s a demand to which de Martel and the Investment Solutions Team at Invesco are responding.
“Our mission is twofold,” says de Martel. “We start by providing analytics so we and the investors can understand what they hold, breaking down an index exposure into regions, sectors, factors, ESG ratings and so on. We have all the necessary tools to facilitate that conversation. The second aspect is to create a custom approach that seeks to achieve investors’ goals. For example, right now in Europe – and increasingly in the U.S. and Asia – a lot of investors have ESG-related goals. More widespread, we’re seeing demand for factor strategies – quality, value, momentum – and how we can blend them into a custom index that allows a custom fixed income portfolio to match certain maturities, for example. We can package investment strategies and goals in an index. We think there will be a shift from first-generation index managers to a newer generation of customized indexes, and we are leading the way.”
Not the same old beta
What investors might find most attractive about adding custom indexes to a modern barbell strategy is that it’s not just an exercise in casting a net for off-the-shelf beta returns. Constructed correctly, a custom index is more the equivalent of an active quantitative strategy with the potential to add returns somewhere between market cap and pure alpha – but without the active quant fees. 
“A customized index we create for an investor is more systematic in nature, like factor strategies,” says Neil Blundell, Head of Global Client Solutions, Head of Alternative Solutions, Invesco. “Invesco’s in-house Indexing team is also key to helping deliver tailored index solutions to our clients, in more cost-efficient ways than licensing data from third-party providers. They work with our clients using a systematic, rules-based transparent process that follows an index design and includes the exposures you’re looking for and how you want to achieve the desired outcome. Once we have worked with our clients to create their desired exposures, they can execute on their end, or let Invesco handle the index replication and daily activity. Because indexation is systematic, it can be extremely cost-effective, freeing up client capital to allocate to the other end of the barbell, in private markets.”
As an example, Blundell offers up a hypothetical investor who wants exposure to a specific region’s small caps, combining the size and quality factor. Typically, that investor would find an active manager, which in turn would likely tilt toward smaller caps or mid-caps, and tilt toward towards quality and maybe value. The investor ideally achieves the desired risk and return profile of the mandate, but at a cost which is a hurdle for active managers to overcome from the start. We believe active management maintains an important role in client portfolios for both return-enhancement properties, but also risk-mitigation. We work with clients across the active/passive spectrum, who are using indexed strategies to complement active managers. The benefits of this are twofold: investors can, ideally, offset costs while also reducing tracking error to a benchmark. This is the case for both passive market-beta and factor-based index strategies.
“By leveraging a custom index in that scenario,” says Blundell, “the investor gets consistent and specific exposure to the market exposures and or factors they desire, with the ability to look-back in time and see how the index has evolved. If an active manager is just using static factor weights, that’s probably not worth significant additional cost because that can be replicated pretty easily and systematically.”  
Start the conversation to better outcomes.

Brian Levitt
Global Market Strategist
Key takeaways
The economy is hot
Leading indicators suggest that above-trend growth may be in store for the foreseeable future.
There’s capacity in the economy to increase production
Businesses are hiring and investing, and capital expenditures are back to pre-pandemic levels.
We don’t expect a rate increase until late next year
The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten policy meaningfully just yet given the “real” unemployment rate.

If you follow me on social media or listen to our podcast , you won’t be shocked to learn that my colleagues and I are bullish on equities. But why? There are several reasons — 10, in fact — which I’ve compiled below.
1. It’s early in the business cycle
Equity markets tend to lead the business cycle, and this cycle appears to have room to run. The last five elongated US business cycles lasted an average of 7 years and produced, on average, a cumulative 25% growth in US real gross domestic product (GDP).1 The current cycle is only one year old, and US real GDP is only just returning to where it was at the start of 2020.
2. The economy is hot
Consumer spending,2 business investment,3 and housing4 are all booming at the same time. Leading indicators for the global economy are approaching multi-year highs, suggesting that the economy may grow above trend for the foreseeable future.5
3. A strong economy suggests companies could grow into their valuations
There’s been a lot of hand wringing about valuations, but valuations are almost always elevated one year after a recession.6 However, history informs us that stocks grew into their multiples after every recession since the early 1990s. Leading indicators signal that a V-shaped recovery in earnings growth could be imminent.7 Our research shows that stocks produced consistent double-digit returns during periods of positive earnings growth over the past 31 years, regardless of what multiples did.8
4. Financial conditions are the loosest on record
Interest rates are low,9 the US dollar is relatively weak,10 corporate bond spreads are tight,11 and the equity market is at or near all-time highs.12 Admittedly that all may sound ominous to investors, but historically the time to become concerned has been when financial conditions have tightened meaningfully, and not when they are historically easy.
5. The Federal Reserve isn’t expected to raise rates until late 2022
In short, don’t fight the Fed. The process of policy normalization may be in the offing, but the Fed is unlikely to tighten policy meaningfully with the “real” unemployment rate, which includes part-time workers and those who are marginally attached to the labor force, still above 10%.
6. Historically, it’s not the first interest rate hike that tends to matter anyway
A review of past initial rate hikes in business cycles (’94, ‘04, ’15) indicates that returns remain robust in the 12 months prior to, and 36 months post, the first interest rate hike, weakening only when the US Treasury yield curve flattens.13
7. The bond market believes the rate of inflation may moderate.
Short-term inflation expectations are above 3%, but 3-year and 5-year inflation expectations are around 2.5%,14 closer to the Fed’s perceived “comfort zone.” If accurate, then near-term inflation that’s supportive of corporate earnings, followed by moderating inflation pressure that allows the Fed to maintain policy support, feels like a very favorable backdrop for risk assets.
8. There is capacity in the economy to increase production.
Businesses are not only looking to rehire to match the growing demand15 but are also investing to rebuild inventories16 and improve productive capabilities, both of which should suppress inflation concerns. Capital expenditures are back to pre-pandemic levels.17 The “real” unemployment rate, which includes part-time employees and those who are only marginally attached to the labor force, stands at 10.2%, suggesting that the economy isn’t close to full employment.18
9. There’s a lot of money on the sidelines.
There is $20 trillion total in cash, checking deposits, savings deposits, and other “near money.”19 While investors focus on goods inflation, it is reasonable to expect that “too much money, chasing too few assets” could result in asset price inflation.
10. Investors are not euphoric about equities.
It is said that market cycles tend to end in investor euphoria. Investors, since the global financial crisis, have allocated over $3 trillion into bond mutual fund and ETF strategies and over $1 trillion into money market strategies. On the other hand, investors have only allocated a cumulative $550 billion to equity strategies.20 It appears there’s space to go before investors appear “euphoric”.
As my colleague Talley Leger opined, “the best may be yet to come”.

Invesco Global Consulting teamed up with political consultant and word specialist, Maslansky + Partners, for a six-month study on what investors think. What do they value and how should their financial professionals respond? Do they want “low-cost” or “high-value”? “A financial plan” or “financial planning”? “Discretionary accounts” or “financial professional-managed accounts”?

The study included financial professional interviews, investor dial sessions, and a survey of 1,000 North American investors. The research uncovered new “cries” from investors and resonating responses from financial professionals when defending, defining, and delivering value.

Given how dynamic, volatile, and rapidly evolving our industry has become, it's your team's ability to challenge your assumptions, admit and correct your mistakes, anticipate your clients' needs, and constantly fine- tune your business model may not only ensure your survival, but also ultimately, your success.
In the past two decades-plus, we have found that our most underutilized and untapped resource is the collective intellect and insights of our teammates, which often lie dormant in even some of our most productive teams. Rather than unlock and mine this resource on a regular basis, we often allow the demands of our practices to so consume us that meaningful collaboration and conversations get swept downstream for another day.

The Chinese local bond market is the second largest single-country domestic bond market in the world after the US2, with a total size of close to USD 17 trillion.3 Approximately 34% of the market consists of central government and policy bank bonds that make up the risk-free portion of the Chinese market and that are easily accessed by offshore investors. The credit sectors and local government sectors make up most of the balance of the market, but require specialized credit skills, and are more difficult for offshore investors to access. We see value for US Investors in central government and policy bank bonds, which offer high credit quality and very good liquidity. Indeed, this is also the part of the Chinese bond market that is now included in some government bond indices, including the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index. The Chinese government and policy bank bonds now yield over 3% and are currently offering positive real yields.4
China as a diversifier
The Chinese economy is a large and domestically focused economy. While tied to the global economic cycle, it can show significant divergence from the global cycle, and this can be a benefit to investors through diversification.5 The path of the global economy through the COVID-19 shock is a perfect example of the benefits of this diversification. The Chinese economy was the first to slow, but also bounced back more quickly than any western economy. The US and Europe are both still in the early stages of recovery from the COVID-19 shutdown, while China is well ahead, to the extent that policymakers are already removing stimulus. China is on a different cycle than the rest of the developed world – that is good news for investors in China right now.
Why look at Chinese bonds now
US fixed income investors have a tough task ahead of them:

Negative real yields mean that inflation adjusted, US Treasury and many investment grade bonds will likely have negative returns.
Overall yields are still very low in historic terms and have a lot more room to rise than fall – potentially creating more negative total returns in the future.
The US government is undertaking fiscal largesse at an unprecedented pace. Direct fiscal stimulus totaling 25% of GDP has been put into the economy in the last 18 months.6
All this spending and easy policy may lead to even more inflation.  We believe much of recent inflation is transitory, but the risk of a continued rise in inflation is clear.
The US Federal Reserve may eventually have to take its foot off the gas, and fixed income investors know how tricky that can be. If fixed income investors are not worried about a “taper tantrum”, they should be.
History tells us that when inflation is increasing and central banks are tightening, it is a poor time for fixed income investments.

Chinese Fixed Income potentially avoids these problems:

10-year Chinese Government bond in renminbi yield 3.15%7, while most recent Chinese CPI is 1.3% yoy.8 This means Chinese fixed income offers positive real yields (nominal yields less inflation) and much higher outright yields than US fixed income9. The Chinese government has not followed the US path of fiscal profligacy and has followed an orthodox fiscal path over recent years. The People’s Bank of China is already well into a tightening cycle, so the tricky transition away from super-easy policy could be avoided.

The investment opportunity
While other major bond markets have posted negative returns so far this year, stable yields and an appreciating currency have provided attractive returns to investors in Chinese fixed income, with low levels of risk relative to many other markets (Figure 1).

Our Q1 2021 multi-sector outlook assesses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the US election on our macro factor framework, asset allocation, and risk position.
Macro factor summary
We continue to expect growth expectations to bounce back strongly in 2021 as a result of vaccine distribution and large stimulus packages. Although base effect should push up inflation in the first half of 2021, we expect inflation to remain well contained in the medium term due to excess capacity in the service sector and residual impacts of COVID-19.
Asset allocation summary
Our macro factor framework suggests neutral positions in global duration and credit, and an underweight position in the US dollar.
Risk position summary
Underlying growth momentum is relatively supportive for risk-taking, but valuations are tight, in our view. We prefer to stay neutral in risky assets and use sell-offs as an opportunity to buy risky markets that we believe will be supported by the fundamentals in the medium term.

Invesco Global Market Strategy Office



In just over a year, the world has gone through incredible change – thrown into a pandemic and plunged into a global recession. We last put out an outlook at the end of last year, sharing our expectations for 2021. In that outlook, our base case anticipated an effective vaccine rollout that improved confidence and lowered infection rates, with the US experiencing a strong economic re-opening in the second quarter, followed by the eurozone. We favored risk assets and preferred cyclicals over defensives in this environment. We have largely seen that expectation come to fruition.
Now, as we look to the back half of 2021, we at Invesco have again brought together some of our most experienced investment professionals and thought leaders to provide a mid-year update to our outlook. 
To continue to address the breadth of possibilities that lie ahead in the environment, we have provided a base case scenario which we believe is highly probable, and two other possible scenarios.

Base case anticipates a strong economic re-acceleration with temporary inflation.
Pandemic Resurgence Scenario anticipates a resurgence of the pandemic that negatively impacts economic growth.
High Inflation Scenario anticipates a strong economic re-acceleration with persistently higher inflation.

Key takeaways
COVID variants spark concern
As the world watches the spread of Delta, the Lambda variant has recently emerged.
Israel voices worry about Delta variant
Even with high vaccination rates, Israel may contemplate reimposing certain restrictions in response to variants.
Markets could react if news worsens
I don’t expect a repeat of 2020’s stringent lockdowns, but we could see an increase in stock market volatility if cases rise.

For much of last year, I believe every single blog I wrote included comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. And then effective vaccines were developed in what to me was nothing short of a medical miracle. Re-openings and the global economic rebound captured more attention. We were even able to worry about inflation — something that would have seemed like a luxury a year ago. But I am now revisiting COVID-19 given recent events. 
Variants emerge as a global concern
The Delta variant (B.1.617) is spreading at a rapid rate, which has caused the World Health Organization to label it as a “variant of concern.” To be specific, the Delta variant is spreading approximately 50% faster than the Alpha variant, which in turn spread approximately 50% faster than the original virus.1 The Delta variant is formidable; it has been described as “the most hypertransmissible, contagious version of the virus we’ve seen to date, for sure — it’s a superspreader strain if there ever was one” by Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine and an executive vice president at the Scripps Research Institution.2
Of course that is a concern for countries with low vaccination rates. However, I have received questions about why that should be of concern for countries with high vaccination levels. For context, I turn to Israel, which I’ve long stated represents the gold standard in effective vaccination rollouts. 
Israel voices worry about Delta variant
Israel had an extremely successful vaccination campaign, with 59.9% of the population fully vaccinated, and 65.4% receiving at least one dose.3  Israel was able to drive down COVID-19 infections to five new cases on May 30, but now that the Delta variant is spreading, it is up to 496 new cases on July 5.4 Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett warned that with the Delta variant “running amok,” Israel may need to reimpose certain restrictions that were lifted when infection levels had gone down.5 That’s because vaccines such as Pfizer seem to be less effective in protecting against the Delta variant of the virus than originally thought. Israel has found that the Pfizer vaccine is only 64% effective in preventing both infection and symptomatic disease, although it remains 93% effective in preventing hospitalization.6 This is similar to the findings we have seen from the UK. 
This is both positive and negative: the good news is that these two vaccines are still very effective in preventing serious illness from the Delta variant. The bad news is that they may not be as effective in stopping the spread of the virus. And so in a country like the US, where there are portions of the country with low vaccination levels interspersed with portions with high vaccination levels, the Delta variant could still spread. In essence, the hoped-for “vaccination wall” may be more of a “vaccination speed bump” — especially now that nearly all mask mandates have been lifted.
The UK is planning to reopen fully on July 19, which includes no mask and social distancing requirements (although contact tracing will remain in place as well as isolation requirements for those testing positive). With high vaccination levels (using AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccine) and growing COVID-19 cases, this will prove an interesting test case to watch as virus data unfolds. 
Also, we do not know the effectiveness of many other vaccines relative to the Delta variant, but they could offer less protection. Differences in efficacy levels may mean different outcomes for different countries depending on the vaccines they used/are using to vaccinate their populations.

Lambda variant is spreading in South America
Finally, we have a new variant of COVID-19 to watch — the Lambda variant (C.37). It is not yet listed as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization, but given its rapid spread in South America, that could change. Concerns are already being raised that some vaccines may not be very effective in protecting against this strain, so we will have to follow it closely. 
The reality is that the longer it takes to vaccinate countries, the more risk arises that even more potent strains of COVID-19 may develop. This is particularly concerning in emerging markets countries, which still need far more assistance in vaccinating their populations than developed countries have provided. While the development of these vaccines remains a medical miracle, they are only as good as their distribution — and of course they are not perfectly effective against mutations that continue to be created.
Implications for investors
Why should this matter to investors? Well, we certainly don’t expect the kind of lockdowns we saw during the first wave of COVID-19 last year (although we could see some renewed stringency, as evidenced by what Israel is considering). Yet markets could react as news develops. For example, while market sentiment toward the UK is growing bullish on reopening, an about-face in virus policy could quickly reverse this.
Recently, we have had days when the yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell despite inflationary pressures and signs of improving economic growth; the drop was attributed by many to the spread of the Delta variant. I would concur. Similarly, we could see stocks experience volatility and sell-offs if COVID-19 infection rates continue to rise, or variants develop that are even more contagious or dangerous. And in terms of emerging markets, some countries’ recoveries may be delayed because of more contagious variants. In my view, this reinforces the need for a discerning approach to EM investing — one that takes a bottom-up view of growth opportunities, versus simply seeking out broad-based exposure.

Key takeaways
The style question misses the point
The market has a valuation attached to it, but we don’t buy the market. We buy a highly curated list of great ideas all around the world.
Structural growth trends endure
We look for companies that have a competitive advantage within broader structural growth themes that are changing the world, such as e-commerce and cloud software.

I often get asked about my team’s outlook, or our thoughts on “What’s the market going to do from here?”  Well, we don’t make market predictions for a living. I’ve yet to see the person in this industry, no matter how bright they may be, who can consistently make money from correctly calling what the short-term gyrations of the market are going to look like. 
In particular, there seems to be a great deal of controversy in the financial media around the question of valuation and the struggle between “value” and “growth” for style supremacy. People love labels. But the people who have known me for the past 20 years know I hate labels.  I believe they’re the enemy of great investing.  
The style question misses the point
In general, I think the entire discussion around style misses the point. The market has a valuation attached to it – sometimes it’s fair and sometimes it’s too high or low. But we don’t buy the market, we buy a highly curated list of great ideas all around the world. We look for companies that have a competitive advantage within broader structural growth themes that are changing the world — things like e-commerce, cloud software, medical diagnostics and life sciences tools, digital payments, and immuno-oncology.
In my view, the price-to-earnings ratio of individual stocks or sectors is useless information without a thorough understanding of what is happening to their fundamentals. Both have to be taken together.  We’re not concerned about the valuation of what we own; we own stocks because we believe their fundamentals are very, very strong and there is much that we like about these businesses. 
A commodity supercycle?
Many commentators like to fill airtime speculating that we’re in the early stages of a commodity supercycle, a similar dynamic to what drove the last period of value outperformance back in 2000-2007. This may make for entertaining television, but we think the parallels they’re drawing are wrong. In our view, what fueled that bull market in commodities was the huge level of capital investment required to urbanize China, which is a demographic wave that is unprecedented in human history and it won’t be repeated any time soon, maybe ever. 
Rather, we’d bet this is a market cycle, unfolding in a normal rhythm, but off of a level of severity that has been extremely rare due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Early expansion periods tend to favor value
So where are we in that market cycle? Historically in a recession, amid an environment of weak earnings and declining interest rates induced by central bank policies, stocks often begin to move up. Multiple expansion can occur quickly in the stocks most levered to a recovery (such as cyclicals with debt on the balance sheet), as the market looks past the current weakness in the economy. Strong earnings may last a year or two as the market cycle plays out, but that early multiple expansion is where the best returns have often happened across the whole cycle for value stocks.1 
And indeed, if you were waiting for the recovery in value coming out of the pandemic … it’s already happened. It may surprise many readers, for example, that the Russell 1000 Value Index has outperformed the Russell 1000 Growth Index prettily handily on a trailing 12-month basis.2 The big “value” multiple expansion was a back half of 2020 and early 2021 phenomenon (see Figure 1).

Many plan sponsors are moving beyond aggregate data reviews and diving deeper into their defined contribution (DC) plan analytics to identify — and solve for — plan design gaps impacting retirement readiness across various employee segments. Adding an in-depth analytics component is essential in evaluating the effectiveness of existing plan design and engagement strategies, as well as identifying and implementing necessary changes. 
An increasing number of sponsors are using “big data” to better inform their retirement plan tactics to solve for broader workplace initiatives, including retention and recruitment, workforce management and evolving demographics, and employee engagement. DC plan analytics can also measure a sponsor’s return on the significant capital allotted to their plans. And, they can help inform the decision to implement or change a plan design strategy (or not) depending upon the impact to the company’s bottom line.
In this article, we examine how sponsors are looking to data that can be “sliced and diced” to identify a problem across a segment of employees and determine plan design and engagement solutions to help. Such analysis can project how much various plan-design changes would affect specific sponsor concerns such as:

Saving for retirement
Pre-retiree transitions

Key takeaways
US household savings diverge
Some households have no savings, while others are growing theirs — but both are bad for business.
Stimulus is stalling out
Without adequate fiscal stimulus, high unemployment and rising virus cases will likely halt the economy.

Last Friday marked the day many Americans would begin losing federal unemployment benefits. We are already starting to see a stalling of economic data, and families losing their benefits could make August’s data even worse. Consider that 37% of American households do not have enough savings to meet a $400 emergency expense — and that statistic comes from a Federal Reserve survey conducted before the pandemic hit the US.1 In addition, other households — with mostly white-collar employees who are able to work from home — are not spending much and instead continue to hold elevated levels of cash, as seen in a relatively high personal savings rate of 19% for the month of June.2 This isn’t a good sign for businesses that rely on consumer spending — and I believe that savings rate is likely to move higher if the virus is not controlled. 
The US Senate still seems far from reaching a deal — at least one that addresses all the pressing needs facing America, including state and local government funding. I suspect August will be something of a “Great Stall” for the US economy if high unemployment and rising virus cases persist without adequate fiscal stimulus. As Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell stressed last week: “The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus.”3 Powell also felt it important to add that, in this environment, more fiscal stimulus is critically needed (and, of course, the Fed will remain extremely accommodative).
In this article, I explore:

The dichotomous savings rate in the US and the impact on consumer spending
The persistence of the virus and decoupling of economies which cannot control its spread

Invesco Fixed Income



Today’s fixed income investors are facing new and unique challenges as traditional fixed income investments are providing historically low income and are increasingly vulnerable to rising interest rates — but senior loans could help. There are several reasons to consider senior loans as a compelling strategic allocation option in your portfolio:

In today’s landscape of low rates and yields, senior loans have provided one of the best yields in fixed income making them a compelling option as a strategic allocation.1

Senior loans are floating rate debt instruments, which results in very low sensitivity to interest rate movements. Historically, senior loans have demonstrated very strong performance during previous periods of rising rates.

Given their senior, secured status, senior loans are the first to be repaid in the case of default and have historically exhibited a lower volatility profile compared to junior high yield bonds.

Senior loans have historically had low correlation with other types of fixed income investments. As a result, they can complement other traditional fixed income holdings and serve as a portfolio diversifier while potentially mitigating volatility.


When choosing a senior loan partner, it’s critical to look for a team that recognizes the implications of a changing global economy and understands the details of thousands of loan issuers. With over $34 billion in assets under management, Invesco is one of the world’s largest managers of senior loans. Our size and scale can lead to many benefits, such as preferred allocations on new issuance and the ability to execute trades inside the bid/ask spread.

So, what exactly has been accomplished by this unified Democratic government three months into the Biden administration?
As promised during the campaign, Biden was quick to stop the US from withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO). The administration also made good on its commitment to produce a federal mask mandate and took executive action to provide relief directly to renters and student loan borrowers. Most importantly, it only took 50 of the famous first 100 days to draft, debate, and pass a sprawling $1.9 trillion rescue bill with only Democratic votes. Between the stimulus effect of that package and the re-openings we are witnessing across the United States, federal economists predict real GDP growth of 4.5% in 2021.1

Key takeaways
Last week’s US Consumer Price Index print was higher than expected
Investors immediately assumed that the Fed would raise rates more quickly, causing the yield curve to flatten.
I don’t believe the inflation data point suggests the Fed will hasten raising rates
The Fed’s dual mandate is focused not just on maintaining price stability but also achieving full employment — and the data shows we still have a long way to go before we get there.
The ECB is altering its monetary policy for the first time in nearly 20 years
The ECB seems to be following in the Fed’s footsteps in terms of becoming more flexible on an overshoot of target inflation so long as it is moderate and temporary.

I just returned last week from travels in the South and Midwest of the United States with my daughter and her basketball team. My time was spent in several different cities where their tournaments were being played, and I was sadly struck by how slowly the economy has re-opened in those cities. In walking around, I saw a number of empty storefronts where shops and restaurants had gone out of business as a result of the pandemic. I saw a movie theater that had shuttered its doors in March of 2020, a heavy layer of dust covering some leftover cardboard popcorn buckets like the ashes of Pompeii (apologies for being dramatic but these are heartbreaking scenes). This is the “economic scarring” that Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jay Powell talked about. And this scarring has occurred in many countries around the world.   Granted this could have been far worse had it not been for a significant amount of fiscal stimulus, but damage has been done.
This economic scarring can contribute to inflationary pressures. For example, because some restaurants have closed, there are fewer restaurants in operation. That means that calling for dinner reservations for the basketball team became a Herculean task. When we were lucky enough to find tables at a restaurant, we discovered that the cost of meals was much higher than two summers ago when we were last at tournaments and dining out. And of course, a key reason for the price increases has been that restaurants and stores are having difficulty sourcing labor — as evidenced by the somewhat desperate “help wanted” signs posted around various cities and towns across America. It will take time for economies to adjust and work through the economic dislocations that have occurred.

And that brings me to the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print released last week. It was higher than expected — and was met with concern by many pundits and strategists. I can’t say I was terribly surprised. We are in an incredibly unique time in economic history, and so I believe all bets should be off about data such as inflation. I continue to believe that much of the rise in inflation we are seeing is temporary. To put it simply, inflation occurs when too much money chases too few goods and services. The re-opening of the economy post-pandemic is an extraordinary event that has created a colossal burst of inflation, but like the pandemic itself, I expect it to only last temporarily. For example, one key driver of this higher-than-expected CPI report was used cars. Higher used car prices are a result of the post-pandemic environment we are in. They are a function of base effects — far fewer used cars were being sold last year at this time — plus difficulty purchasing new cars because of supply chain disruptions as well as a change in transportation choices given ongoing health concerns (i.e., a preference for avoiding mass transit).

But the reaction by many, as evidenced in the behavior of the 10-year US Treasury yield, was not to drive up longer-term rates because of expectations that inflation will be higher. Instead the yield curve flattened as investors immediately assumed that the Fed would raise rates more quickly, and that such action would dampen economic growth. However, I don’t believe the inflation data point gives any reason to expect that the Fed will hasten raising rates. Last year the Fed adopted a new inflation targeting policy, and I really believe it is a paradigm shift. Put simply, it appears the Fed is going to be more tolerant of the overshooting of inflation.1 And let’s not forget the Fed has a dual mandate; it’s not just about maintaining price stability but it’s also about achieving full employment. And as we know from the data, we are still far from full employment.  Finally, concerns are also mounting about what the spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant could do to slow the global economic recovery; we have to recognize that if it negatively impacts the US economy, it could easily push back the Fed’s tightening timeline.

Speaking of new monetary policy, the European Central Bank (ECB) just completed an exhaustive monetary policy review and has made the decision to alter its monetary policy for the first time in nearly 20 years. The ECB reaffirmed that forward guidance, quantitative easing, and targeted long-term refinancing options (TLTROs) will remain policy tools. It also included a climate action plan intended to ensure that the ECB supports environmental responsibility and fights climate change through monetary policy tools. For example, the ECB will adjust “the framework guiding the allocation of corporate bond purchases to incorporate climate change criteria, in line with its mandate.”2

What’s most interesting right here and now is that the ECB seems to be following in the Fed’s footsteps in terms of becoming more flexible on an overshoot of target inflation so long as it is moderate and temporary (although the ECB’s policy is a weaker version of the Fed’s). This means the ECB is likely to provide support to the eurozone economy for longer in an economic crisis, rather than acting preemptively to head off inflation, and running the risk of a premature tightening that chokes off recovery. 

For the recovery at hand, we think this means the ECB will look through the current rebound in inflation, and continue with asset purchases and negative rates for months to come. This would be very different from its decisions during the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2010 eurozone crisis. Both times, it raised rates in response to early signs of inflation, probably making each downturn worse than it needed to be. We would expect this shift in the ECB’s approach to translate into greater market confidence, holding in sovereign spreads and supporting risk assets through the unfolding economic rebound. It will be interesting to see how the ECB begins to implement its policy change at this week’s meeting.

Finally, I think it’s important to address the current global stock market sell-off that is underway. The 10-year Treasury yield has dropped significantly as “risk off” sentiment permeates global markets. As I have said before, we shouldn’t be surprised that stocks are finally experiencing losses. I have been waiting for this given that it has been a long time since we saw a large sell-off. And it stands to reason that we would experience one now as COVID-19 jitters have re-emerged with the spread of the Delta variant and as the Fed prepares to transition to the start of monetary policy normalization with an anticipated announcement on the start of tapering soon. But that is no reason to panic; neither one of our tail risk scenarios that I articulated in our mid-year outlook has come to fruition. I believe the bull market is far from over — it is just catching its breath. Stay calm, stay diversified, and for those with cash on the sidelines, look for buying opportunities.

Key takeaways
Inflation fears have turned to a growth scare
Investors turn their attention to the rising cases of the coronavirus attributed to the Delta variant.
Remember that market drawdowns are not uncommon
They tend to be the result of policy uncertainty — in this case, policy related to COVID-related shutdowns.
A growth scare now is likely to ultimately extend this business and market cycle
It is likely to ease the pressure that had been growing on the US Federal Reserve to begin tightening policy conditions.

This may be one of those strange times when market analysts, having just spent months telling everyone that the economy isn’t as robust and inflationary as they believe it to be, must now convince everyone that the economy isn’t as bad as they think.  
Nonetheless, we view the current backdrop as a growth slowdown in what will still be a long economic cycle.

What’s the market telling us?

We’ve always said that of all the indicators, the bond market tends to get it right most often.  For the past year, the bond market had not been signaling meaningful inflation concerns. Consider that the 10-year rate had fallen from a post-recession peak of 1.74% at the end of March to 1.29% at the end of last week. It is down by nearly 11 basis points today to 1.18%.1 Inflation fears have turned to a growth scare as investors turn their attention to the rising cases of the coronavirus attributed to the Delta variant.

A bull flattening of the yield curve (long-term rates decreasing more rapidly than short-term rates) has historically not been a great near-term environment for equities. In the last cycle, long rates converged toward short rates in 2010-2011 (European debt crisis), 2014-2015, and 2015-2016 (China currency devaluation).1 During those periods there were drawdowns in the S&P 500 Index of -15%, -5%, and -12%, respectively. In each of those instances, growth stocks outperformed value stocks.2

Lest we get too concerned, remember that market drawdowns are not uncommon. They tend to be the result of policy uncertainty. The policy uncertainty is now less about monetary policy and instead about policy related to COVID-related shutdowns. Whether or not a drawdown occurs is likely to be immaterial. The median intra-year decline in stocks over the past four decades is close to 10%.3 The median annualized total return over that period is over 14%.3 Stay the course.

Have we changed our view on the cycle?

Critically, it is a bear flattening of the yield curve (where short-term rates move higher than long-term rates) that tends to signal that the economic cycle is in danger. That is not what is happening in the bond market today.4

A growth scare is likely to ease the pressure that had been growing on the US Federal Reserve to begin tightening policy conditions. As such, a growth scare now is likely to ultimately extend this business and market cycle. 

The tail risk to this outlook is that the delta variant leads to widescale shutdowns of the economy and another recession. It is important to note that the country, given the vaccine rollout, is in a much better place than it was months ago. On a national basis, active hospitalizations remain low, albeit climbing.5 

Vaccination rates appear to be having a significant impact on the severity of Delta’s spread. The per capita level of new cases and hospitalizations is 3-4x higher in the quartile of least vaccinated states than in the quartile of most vaccinated states.6 However, a silver lining to these developments is that the vaccine rollout picked up slightly over the past week.6

It’s understandable why some are concerned about the current drawdown, but in my opinion, this is no time to worry. Investors should consider where we are in the economic cycle and consider that while we are once again facing some policy uncertainty due to COVID-19, that doesn’t mean the market won’t rebound.

Key takeaways
The past month saw a pause in the recent cyclicals/reflation theme
Large caps and quality stocks outperformed small caps and value stocks, and cyclical sectors underperformed growth and defensive sectors.
The catalyst for this reversal is tied to the latest Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting
The Fed’s hawkish tone led to the repricing of monetary policy expectations and a sharp decline in long-term bond yields.
Currently, our framework still points toward an expansionary regime
We continue to favor equity markets outside the US, and cyclical styles/factors such as value, small caps, and mid caps.

Our framework continues to suggest the economy is in expansion. Looking ahead, we assess the probability of a short-term peak in the cycle over the next few months and place it in context with recent monetary policy developments.
We have implemented no changes in the Invesco Global Allocation Fund1 and maintain a higher risk posture than our benchmark with an overweight to equities and risky credit at the expense of investment grade and government bonds. We continue to favor equity markets outside the US, and cyclical styles/factors such as value, small caps, and mid caps, despite their recent performance pullback. 
Macro update
Over the past month, markets experienced a pause in the cyclicals/reflation theme that drove global asset prices for the past year. Large caps and quality stocks outperformed small caps and value stocks, and cyclical sectors such as financials, materials, and industrials underperformed growth and defensive sectors like technology, communication services, and health care. The US yield curve flattened by about 25 basis points (bps), commodities leveled off, and breakeven inflation expectations declined by about 15 bps in the month of June.2

While the extent of the price action is indicative of overcrowded positioning in the reflation trade, the catalyst for such reversal has valid fundamental justifications related to the hawkish tone from the last Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting, the repricing of monetary policy expectations, and the sharp decline in long-term bond yields. With the Fed acknowledging the strength of the recovery, markets have repriced a higher probability of interest rate hikes in 2023 and 2024. However, the far more relevant and peculiar development occurred in the long end of the curve which saw 10-year and 30-year bond yields decline by about 15-20 bps in June. Such repricing is consistent with market expectations that any early withdrawal of monetary policy support, coupled with the gradual normalization of budget deficits, will quickly lead the economy back to the low-growth, low-inflation paradigm that characterized the post-GFC (global financial crisis) environment. As policy support is gradually removed, the strength of the economy will depend on private sector demand stepping in to make up the difference. Ultimately, the low level of real interest rates is driven by global excess savings relative to consumption, and expectations for high propensity to save in the private sector. In other words, the low level of long-term bond yields is effectively implying a low trend-growth rate and low inflation environment driven by high precautionary savings. 

Paradoxically, the hawkish innovation of the Fed led to lower bond yields and easier financial conditions, while at the same time meaningfully reducing “inflation fears” that characterized a growing risk scenario for asset prices over the past few months. We believe this is a good development for financial markets, likely leading to lower volatility and less dispersion in returns across asset classes. 

How do these developments relate to our macro framework, and what can we expect over the next few months? 

As of now our framework still points toward an expansionary regime, where growth is expected to be solidly above trend for the foreseeable future and continuing to improve in the near term. (Figure 1). However, we believe that the post-Fed repricing of medium-term growth expectations is not at odds with our macro analysis. Looking at our global leading economic indicator from a long-term perspective does suggest we are approaching levels that have historically coincided with cyclical peaks in the economy (Figure 2).

Key takeaways
We look for trends that are changing the world
For over 50 years, finding structural growth opportunities has been at the core of the Invesco Global Fund’s investment philosophy.
We seek out companies that are excelling in these areas
Having identified these powerful structural trends, we then search for exceptional companies that we believe will be leaders in these areas.
We’re patient
We believe that the companies we own have the potential to deliver durable growth over a number of years.

We live in a world where new and novel ideas get the most attention. For investors who are just starting out, it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of jumping from one opportunity to the next. Instead of holding on to a good thing, many are constantly trying to identify the next great idea. 
In contrast, my appreciation for the long-term potential of exceptional companies and the benefits of holding on to them has grown over the course of my career. Today, it is a fundamental component of how I invest. There are three steps to this approach.
Step 1: Identify the trends that are changing the world
For over 50 years, finding structural growth opportunities has been at the core of the Invesco Global Fund’s investment philosophy. What does this mean? We seek to take advantage of ongoing trends that are changing people’s everyday lives across the world. 
From tapping into revolutionary developments in technology, to thinking through what the aging global population may mean for robotics and health care, or how we’ll communicate with each other in the future, there are a number of exciting areas we continue to research and see great promise in. This is a much different approach than looking for fleeting fads that are here today and gone tomorrow.
Step 2: Find the companies that are excelling in these areas
Having identified these powerful structural trends, we then search for exceptional companies that we believe will be leaders in these areas.  In our experience, exceptional companies have some common characteristics:

They operate in a good industry that usually features a concentrated competitive structure, where pricing power, organic growth, and good margins are plainly evident.
They are run by astute people who steward the business with proper execution and strong governance.
They rarely, if ever, operate with a heavy balance sheet or rely on significant mergers and acquisitions to grow.

Step 3: Be patient
Once we invest in companies that we believe are leaders in these structural trends, we are patient and allow our companies to grow organically and compound economic returns over time – not over months and quarters, but over years, and even decades.
We believe that the companies we own have the potential to deliver durable growth over a number of years, and the market has a very difficult time pricing that.  So, while a stock’s price could theoretically spike 20% to 30% in a short period of time, we remain focused on all of the opportunity still to come in the years ahead.  Compound performance doesn’t accumulate in a straight line, but if you have the patience and fortitude to let your ideas play out over time, we believe that's key to unlocking organic growth.
Conclusion
In our view, one of the great advantages of thinking structurally is that it essentially tilts the playing field in your favor, and if you’re playing on that field for a long period of time, you can compound that advantage.  We attribute much of our success over the past five decades to this three-step approach.

Real estate investments have historically coalesced around four broadly defined property types: multifamily, industrial, office and retail. But, after the corona shock of 2020, it may make sense for investors to reconsider specialty property sectors – for a more tailored approach to the post-COVID world.
We analyze four specialty real estate sectors, notably: data centers, infrastructure, single family rentals and health care/life science, which could be solid plays for investors in the years to come. We show what these sectors stand to gain from long-term structural changes as well as from the economic situation post-pandemic. While the focus of our analysis in on the US, we believe that the main findings apply to other regions as well.

Key takeaways
Sell-offs have been short
Recently, sell-offs have quickly been followed by a rush back into the stock market by eager buyers.
Headwinds to watch
I’m closely watching four headwinds that could trigger another sell-off.
Fundamentals remain solid
Given solid fundamentals and accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, I expect the stock market to finish the year higher than where it is today.

Last week, in the midst of a market sell-off that rattled investors, I finished my commentary with one final sentence, “Stay calm, stay diversified, and for those with cash on the sidelines, look for buying opportunities.” After I wrote it, I wondered if the stock market would bounce back before investors had the time to look for buying opportunities. After all, that has been the pattern we have seen for more than a year; any sell-off has quickly been followed by a rush back into the stock market by eager buyers. And so it went this time as well — investors hardly had the chance to blink before the rebound happened. But if you think the summer sell-off that many anticipated has come and gone, I believe you are sorely mistaken. I’m closely watching four headwinds that could trigger another sell-off. 
Four headwinds to watch 

COVID spread. COVID-19 continues to spread around the world. In Southeast Asia, a region that escaped the severity of previous waves of infection, a number of countries are experiencing a dramatic increase in Delta variant cases, such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and even Singapore. The situation has gotten particularly bad in Indonesia, with severe oxygen shortages in Bali and Java. What’s more, given double-digit positivity rates, medical experts are worried that Indonesia could be an ideal breeding ground for more variants of COVID-19. Meanwhile, countries with high vaccination rates are struggling with upticks in cases as well, including the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Israel. As has widely been reported, the United States is struggling with the Delta variant as unvaccinated parts of the population are seeing a surge in hospitalizations.

Now the news is not all bad when it comes to COVID-19. After a peak in cases earlier this month, South Africa has finally started to see cases move in the right direction. In the US, White House officials report that vaccinations are actually starting to increase in some of the states where COVID infections are on the rise, such as Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, and Nevada. It seems that a greater effort on the part of elected officials — as well as the disturbing coverage of young people being hospitalized and dying — has helped encourage some reluctant Americans to get vaccinated. However, as we have seen before, any negative COVID headlines can spark jitters in markets.



Vaccine effectiveness questioned. The development of effective vaccines has been critical to the economic turnaround and the strong stock market rally of 2021. So if vaccines were to no longer be very effective in the face of COVID, that could cause a serious case of market nervousness.

The news out of Israel is concerning. Based on national health statistics, researchers have estimated that the Pfizer vaccine was only 39% effective against preventing COVID-19 infection in Israel between June 20 and July 17.1 This is surprising given that, for a time period that overlaps with this period – June 6 through July 3 — the vaccine was estimated to be 64% effective. 1 It is worth noting that there was only a relatively small number of cases included in the study, so it may not be accurate in assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine. However, if this were an accurate estimate, it compares very unfavorably with statistics from earlier in the year; between January and early April, the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 infection. 1 The good news is that thus far, the Pfizer vaccine continues to be more than 90% effective in preventing serious illness. 1

If vaccine effectiveness really has fallen that substantially, one reason could be that the vaccine’s ability to prevent infection may be wearing off. While it would be onerous to have to roll out a booster shot quickly, at least that would mean there is presumably a solution for the lower effectiveness rate. Data should be scrutinized in many countries to get a better sense of vaccine effectiveness. A great experiment is underway in the United Kingdom. COVID-19 related restrictions (masking, social distancing, etc.) were lifted on July 19 despite rising COVID-19 cases fueled by the Delta variant. We will want to follow the situation closely for indications of how well vaccinations have protected UK citizens against the Delta variant. 


Fed tightening fears. Then there is the Federal Reserve. We have the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week — some Fed watchers are anticipating a taper announcement at this meeting, although I think that would be premature (I think it’s more likely we get a taper announcement at Jackson Hole). I empathize with Fed Chair Jay Powell as he walks a delicate tightrope — preparing markets for tapering while assuring that the Fed will be very patient and thoughtful as it starts its normalization process. But it’s not just this FOMC meeting. Just as “Shark Week” seems to last far more than a week, the summer of “Fedspeak” will continue, and let’s face it, any FOMC participant’s words can rattle markets — especially as we get closer to the start of normalization.


US debt ceiling woes. One more item that could add summer swoons for the stock market is the impending debt ceiling. In late June, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned about this issue, as it impacts the ability of the Treasury to issue bonds and pay its bills. Voting on raising the debt ceiling can be politically dangerous for a substantial portion of Congress, adding an extra layer of dysfunction to an already dysfunctional legislative body. While the official expiration date is July 31, we know from recent experience that the government can usually continue to function using “extraordinary measures” until the fall. However, the longer it takes to reach a deal, the greater the potential for volatility. 

Of course, sometimes catalysts for market sell-offs can seemingly come out of nowhere or be lurking in the shadows, so the list above is far from complete.

Stay prepared for sell-offs
In other words, be prepared for more sell-offs. Now, that doesn’t mean stocks will fare poorly for the rest of the year. Given solid fundamentals and the accommodative monetary and fiscal policy backdrop, I expect the stock market to finish the year higher than where it is today — but there could very well be hiccups along the way. So, in advance of the next sell-off, please keep this simple, familiar advice handy: Stay calm, stay diversified, and for those with cash on the sidelines, keep looking for buying opportunities.

Key takeaways
Avoid putting your eggs in one basket
Market capitalization-weighted indexes can often result in just a few companies having an outsized influence on index performance.
Concentration risk has grown
Investors are facing levels of concentration risk not seen in nearly half a century with the S&P 500’s top five holdings growing increasingly large at nearly 22%.
Consider diversifying your portfolio
Investors may wish to implement an equal weight investment approach.

Recent developments in the S&P 500 are an important reminder of the wisdom of the timeless adage: avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Since its low on March 23, 2020, the S&P 500 has notched record gains1 and closed at a record high on Dec. 31, 2020,2 but a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture.
As a market capitalization-weighted index, the S&P 500 typically has a heavy concentration in a few names, and as its top five holdings  as of Dec. 14, 2020 — Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) —have zoomed ever higher in 2020, they have come to dominate the Index’s performance. While the S&P 500 ostensibly measures 500 companies, the five largest companies have grown to account for nearly 22.0%3 of its weighting, a significant rise from 16.8% at the end of 2019.

Key takeaways
Companies are on the forefront of medical screening technology
From at-home samples to rapid mutation tests, we’re seeing major innovations in health care diagnostics.
We’re committed to identifying companies we believe are leading the way in transformational technologies
The companies in which we seek to invest are building businesses that may enjoy a high probability of strong future growth, in our view.

Colon cancer is beatable 90% of the time,1 when caught early enough. And compared to other types of cancers, there is a reliable, if not pleasant, way to detect colon cancer — colonoscopies. However, only 69% of adults between the recommended screening age window of 50 to 70 years go for their colonoscopies.2 A few years ago, Wisconsin-based Exact Sciences launched an alternative method of detecting possible signs of cancer in the colon: Cologuard, which involves an at-home collection of a stool sample, thereby allowing most people to avoid a colonoscopy. This has been so successful that the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) extended the recommended screening age down to 45 years of age.3 As people’s life expectancy continues to grow, it is possible that the upper age limit will be raised as well. (Notably, actor Chadwick Boseman died at just 43 years old after battling colon cancer for four years. While the occurrence of colon cancer becomes more prevalent as people get older, it can occur at any age. Get tested!)

Exact Sciences has grown their product portfolio, first by the acquisition of Genomic Health, and more recently by acquiring Thrive. Genomic Health has tests for breast and prostate cancers, which measure the level of gene expression in tumors, allowing for a more personalized treatment regime. For instance, their Oncotype DX test for women diagnosed with breast cancer indicates which patients can safely skip chemotherapy, as chemotherapy has no benefit for a subset of breast cancer patients.4

In our view, Thrive is an even more innovative company. They are developing a blood test to detect many forms of cancer. This is an even easier test to perform than the at-home Cologuard test, as Thrive would just require a tube of blood, as routinely given at one’s annual checkup. It can also be used for cancer monitoring during treatment, to quickly see if the current treatment is working or if the tumor is changing, perhaps building resistance to the current treatment. It can also help monitor for the return of cancer in recovered patients. While Thrive’s test is still under development and is not yet approved for use, it gives insight into what may be the future of health care diagnostics.

This view is reinforced by Illumina’s proposed acquisition of Grail, which offers similar blood-based tests as Thrive. Illumina is the preeminent “next-generation sequencing” (NGS) company with significant market share, and their machines are in the lab of most innovative testing/diagnostic companies we visit. Their machines are also used by university researchers, pharma companies, genetic medicine companies, and agriculture companies that are interested in identifying the genetics of productive plants and animals. We believe determining the genetic sequence of people, the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the tumors they have, and the viruses they acquire will become increasingly possible, and useful for our day-to-day life.

Next-generation sequencing works in contrast to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which we have all heard of recently in the context of COVID-19 tests. PCR tests look for a known sequence of DNA, while next-generation sequencing allows you to discover which DNA sequences are present when they are initially unknown. Illumina’s machines were used to first sequence the coronavirus that became known as COVID-19, and in our view, they can be crucial in identifying new variants of the virus as it mutates.

PCR testing is very useful for the rapid diagnosis of viruses — especially so in Biocartis’ machines. Biocartis has developed a point-of-care device that takes in a tissue sample or blood sample and returns a result in just 15 minutes. It eliminates the need to send a sample to a lab, and doesn’t even need any specialized preparation of the sample, so it can be used by health care workers in clinics and hospitals. Biocartis’ initial tests were based on detecting particular mutations in tumors, directing doctors to specific drugs that would work for that mutation, but after the outbreak of COVID-19, Biocartis quickly developed a fast PCR test for the virus, using the same device that performs the rapid cancer mutation test. They are working to make a combined flu and COVID-19 test which would quickly diagnose what is happening in a symptomatic patient, and may continue to add more tests to the same device, increasing its usefulness. The COVID-19 outbreak badly affected Biocartis as cancer treatments were disrupted, but we believe in the longer-term value of their platform.

Our investment approach

As the portfolio managers of Invesco Global Opportunities Fund, we don’t try to predict what the market may do six months from now, make guesses about what the Federal Reserve will do on interest rates, or even make predictions about the policies any presidential administration will pursue.

We simply spend our time searching for companies which we believe are leading the way in transformational technologies through patent-protected intellectual property. The companies in which we seek to invest have used these resources to build businesses that may enjoy a high probability of strong future growth.

The improvement in medical diagnostics is a theme we’re excited about — and we believe it may position us to benefit our investors in the years ahead.

Key takeaways
New regulations surprised investors.
Chinese regulators surprised markets by publishing regulations requiring tutoring service providers to be run as not-for-profit entities.
Chinese stocks dropped.
This triggered a substantial sell-off: Chinese tech stocks and Chinese equities in general sold off indiscriminately.
A buying opportunity in tech?
I believe this is an opportunity for investors to look for buying opportunities in Chinese tech stocks, albeit through a discerning lens.

I often use this blog as an opportunity to answer pressing questions from clients. And recently, it seems almost all the questions we are getting are about China – what is going on with Chinese stocks and whether investors should abandon them. The catalyst for these recent jitters: Last week, Chinese regulators surprised markets by publishing regulations requiring tutoring service providers to be run as not-for-profit entities. This triggered a substantial sell-off across Chinese equities.  
What prompted these regulations?
First of all, I think it’s important to understand the rationale for China’s decision on for-profit educational businesses. Currently, it is very expensive for Chinese families to utilize tutors to help their children perform well during their compulsory years of education, but many families view it as a necessity to help their children succeed academically and be accepted at a highly regarded university. The Chinese government recognizes that this places a significant and unfair burden on families – and may be a hindrance to China’s goal of encouraging couples to have larger families. China recognizes that it is in the best interest of the country that all its children have equal access to educational opportunities. It’s clear that the Chinese government is willing to tolerate short-term volatility in order to achieve longer-term goals.
It’s understandable that this regulation of the for-profit education industry, which includes the banning of foreign investors, would exert downward pressure on stocks in that industry. However, the reaction was far more broad-based: Chinese tech stocks and Chinese equities, in general, sold off indiscriminately. I suspect it’s because this decision follows on the heels of a series of other regulatory decisions in recent months that impacted other industries. The objective of these regulatory actions is not to drive foreign investors from China – or for China to undermine its market economy. Rather, authorities seem to be doing what other countries have only talked about doing in terms of addressing issues that have arisen in recent years:

Financial stability: China wants to ensure adequate risk controls for financial services companies, including sufficient capitalization. 
Data protection: Data security is an important issue for all companies and consumers, but countries have done little to protect data. Chinese policymakers believe data security is a national security issue, and as such, do not want foreign entities to have access to Chinese companies’ data.
Break-up of tech monopolies: Authorities are concerned that some companies may gain an unfair ability to set higher prices because they control an industry. They also want to ensure that smaller businesses are not at a disadvantage when competing.
Better conditions for workers: China wants to ensure “gig workers” receive adequate treatment from employers, including earning a living wage and receiving health benefits.
Combating climate change: The government wants to support a “greening” of the economy.

China seeks to calm investor fears
The Chinese government showed that investors matter by quickly pulling together a meeting last week between Chinese regulators and brokerage firms to help explain its most recent decision and to assuage fears. China Securities Regulatory Commission Vice Chairman Fang Xinghai reassured participants that Chinese companies will still be allowed to go public in the United States as long as they meet criteria set out by the Chinese government for listing. That doesn’t mean we won’t see more regulation going forward, as authorities think strategically about the longer term, but I would expect it to be targeted and based on China’s focus on achieving higher-level goals.
My takeaway from this situation is that many Chinese equities, especially Chinese tech companies, have been unfairly punished by investors as a result of recent regulatory actions. However, that has created more attractive valuations. As of July 30, the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio on the MSCI China Index is 18.86, which compares favorably to that of the MSCI World Index at 26.071. Rather than abandoning Chinese tech companies, I believe this is an opportunity for investors to look for buying opportunities, albeit through a discerning lens.

Overview 

Commodity investments can help expand portfolio diversification and provide a degree of inflation protection. 
Favorable supply/ demand dynamics, a surge in green initiatives, and rapidly changing global demographics all bode well for the asset class to finally shake off its prolonged price softness.
 Active management can take advantage of the unique characteristics of commodity investing to strengthen a strategy’s risk/return profile through term structure weighting, equal risk contribution, optimal roll, and tactical allocations.

Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
I believe the Fed’s recent comments on rates are relatively dovish, not hawkish
I fully expect the Fed to announce its plans for tapering in the late summer/early fall and to start tapering by the end of 2021.
The prospect of rate hikes is coming a little too quickly for some
But unlike what we saw with the global financial crisis, this recovery is occurring at relative warp speed in comparison.
The July jobs report was a blowout — which has prompted inflation concerns among some market watchers
There was a better-than-expected increase in jobs and significant growth in wages as well, especially hospitality and leisure, which has caused concern for some.

There were some interesting developments last week that gave some market watchers reasons for concern. However, I believe they are positive.
First of all, in a speech last week Federal Reserve (Fed) Vice Chair Richard Clarida suggested that tapering could be announced soon, and that he expects interest rate hikes to begin in early 2023. Many perceived these comments as hawkish — but in my opinion, they are far from it. Rather, I believe they are rather dovish given the progress the US has made thus far in economic growth in general, and employment in particular. I fully expect the Fed to announce its plans for tapering in the late summer/early fall (probably at its Jackson Hole meeting later this month) and to start tapering by the end of 2021. I think it is more than reasonable to start rate hikes in early 2023 — but I still think the Fed may need to start hiking rates in late 2022. That is still a wonderfully accommodative environment. 

So what has investors rattled about impending monetary policy normalization? Most likely, it’s because it would come relatively quickly after the Fed began easing in response to the pandemic. For many, the frame of reference may be the last crisis (the global financial crisis [GFC]), when it took years from the start of easing for the Fed to begin normalizing monetary policy. In that case, quantitative easing started in December 2008 and tapering began in December 2013, and the Fed started raising the federal funds rate in December 2015 after starting to cut rates in September 2007.1 

This time around, the transition from easing to tightening would occur on a far more compressed timeline. But keep in mind this crisis has been extremely different than the last one. The post-GFC recovery was rather anemic for years — especially when it came to jobs — while this recovery is occurring at relative warp speed in comparison. The level of fiscal stimulus this time around has certainly been a factor; in the GFC, fiscal stimulus in the US comprised about 6% of GDP, while during the pandemic it has comprised 25% of GDP thus far.2 But it’s also the nature of the crisis and its solution, with the speedy development of vaccines still a game changer that has jolted the economy into a strong economic rebound despite difficulties with the rollout of vaccines and the spread of COVID-19 variants. In addition, I believe the Fed is clearly doing a better job of messaging its policy changes this time around, having learned from the past.

Second, the US jobs report for July came out and it was a blowout. There was a large, better-than-expected increase in jobs, especially leisure and hospitality — and don’t forget this follows on the heels of a very strong June jobs report (which was revised upward). But the July jobs report showed significant growth in wages as well, especially hospitality and leisure. And so, while most rejoiced at the jobs report, some expressed concern about inflation. Admittedly, I have said for a while that we need to follow wage growth closely because it is stickier and can result in persistent inflation. However, I do believe wage growth is less “sticky” in the leisure and hospitality space given the high level of employee turnover, which allows for employers to adjust wages far more quickly. We will want to continue to follow wage growth closely, but recognize that the labor market has not normalized yet given that some key causes of labor scarcity — including childcare and COVID-19 fears — are still present, at least for the time being.  There is such a high level of demand for labor, as evidenced by today’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, given the unique circumstances of the recovery.

Not surprisingly, the 10-year US Treasury yield made a nice surge upward to nearly 1.3% on Friday, after a significant slide for several weeks before. From my perspective, that is healthy and is keeping with my view that the 10-year yield will end the year closer to 2% than 1%.

So what am I thinking about this week? I wouldn’t say I’m “worried” about the following, but I am certainly keeping my eye on a few things:


COVID-19 infections and vaccinations: COVID-19 is spreading in many countries, including the US, with hospitalizations on the rise. Vaccination efforts continue in emerging markets but not nearly as quickly as health officials would like to see. The US has benefited from vaccine abundance, and in recent weeks we have seen more people getting vaccinated in states where there has been high vaccine reluctance. Thus far, the resurgence of COVID-19 has not had a material impact on the US economy but that might change, so we will want to follow it closely. 

Many other countries haven’t had as swift a vaccine rollout as the US. I am particularly worried about countries in southeast Asia that were able to handily control the spread of COVID-19 in the last year but are now experiencing a substantial surge in infections. This could in turn result in further supply chain disruptions that could be quite problematic; it’s already happening in countries such as Vietnam. Keep in mind that this is a real problem for the manufacturing sector, as evidenced in the most recent ISM manufacturing survey.3 While one survey respondent in the electronics industry shared that supply chain issues are slowly improving, many other respondents are still facing challenges. One respondent from the machinery industry explained, “Supply chain continues to be extremely challenging in a variety of categories. Having to place orders months ahead of time just to get a place in line.”3 


University of Michigan five-year inflation expectations: I know the July US consumer price index (CPI) print will come out this week, but what I care far more about is preliminary inflation expectations for August — not one year out, as that would reflect more temporary inflation, but further out. And the Fed cares about longer-term inflation expectations too. It seems consumers are less anxious about inflation, as it peaked at 3% in May and has fallen slightly since then.4 I want to be sure it remains on a downward trajectory.


Looking ahead, I expect more volatility for stocks — and Treasuries — as we move through August. We are likely to hear more “Fedspeak,” likely foreshadowing a taper announcement. I don’t expect a taper tantrum like we saw in 2013, but I wouldn’t be surprised by some market fluctuations. In addition, negative news about COVID-19 could, of course, also add substantially to volatility.

Key takeaways
China has ramped up regulations
We have witnessed an acceleration of sharp-speared regulatory interventions across sectors, which has blind-sided investors and untethered confidence in Chinese stocks.
We still see opportunity
Despite feeling downcast about the considerable retreat in a number of our Chinese holdings, we believe considerable opportunities for investors still exist in China, and these should not be dismissed out of hand.
Our outlook remains bullish
We still very much believe that China is in the early stages of what will potentially be one of the great bull markets in human history.

As China ramps up regulations, can investors keep calm and carry on?
Invesco’s Developing Markets team, led by Chief Investment Officer Justin Leverenz, addresses salient questions that have arisen in the last few weeks concerning regulatory interventions in China and how that impacts the team’s outlook for Chinese equities. 
Q. What is the motivating force behind the cascade of regulatory interventions in China over the past few months? Is there an underlying logic to this? 
We have witnessed an acceleration of sharp-speared regulatory interventions across sectors, which has blind-sided investors and untethered confidence in stocks, particularly Chinese American depositary receipt (ADR) listings. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index (HXC), a market capitalization weighted index of Chinese companies listed in the United States, is down nearly 27% year to date.1 
We believe that there are three layers of questions which need to be asked to fully grasp what is going on with these chaotic interventions.  

First are the proximate implications. These questions are around the “what” of new regulations. What regulations have been imposed? What are the implications of these regulations on company growth, market share, and profitability?  
The second layer of questions involves broader policy goals and objectives behind such regulatory change. These questions are the “why” behind these regulatory actions.
The third set involves existential changes in policy behavior. Has there been a fundamental change in behavior, or an existential change in China’s political economy? And what has motivated this change? This layer of questions allows us to speculate beyond the proximate to better grasp what policymakers are trying to incubate in response to diverse tensions, both domestically and internationally. 

We believe the investment community is today focused largely on the proximate layer of questions, which are important in understanding near-term earnings implications. However, in the context of a changing China, these questions are unlikely to be helpful in assessing the value ultimately embedded across companies.  
At the proximate level, we have seen a host of chaotic regulatory change.  

Fintech regulations which disrupted entirely the fast-moving fintech sector and coincided with the failed Ant Group public listing late last year. These regulations were designed to control system leverage (unsecured retail credit), harmonize banking regulation with tech platforms, and reduce moral hazard (with the securitization model of Ant).  
Anti-monopoly regulations oriented around monopolistic competitive behavior and consumer protections. These have a particular focus on dominant internet platforms.
Data security regulation.
Worker protection regulations for gig-workers (food delivery, e-commerce).
Private sector education regulation, which effectively banned much of the organized K-12 after-school tutoring business and led to a near mortal demise of the hitherto fast-growing industry.
Content restrictions on entertainment and fresh attacks on social media — and perhaps soon on short-form video platforms, including the role of celebrities, influencers and opinion-leaders.

In this environment of accelerated regulatory intervention and fast-developing news, questions that need to be answered are around implications for company growth and profitability. We have seen a violent initial reaction as investors grapple with understanding first derivative implications to company valuations.  
Now let us consider the “why.”  
The second set of questions — those that involve the motivations behind these policy shifts — seem reasonably clear to us. However, these forces are highly nuanced and inter-linked. Let us consider these layers of “why” one by one.  
Firstly, two key threads are quite obvious: 

Inequality in China following three decades of unbridled growth. Policymakers in China — like much of the rest of the world — are seeking to shift the balance of increasingly asymmetric distribution of returns between capital and labor. There is a well-articulated attempt to improve social mobility, to create greater equality of opportunity via fair competition and regulation of monopolistic practices.  
Development of China’s capital markets. We also think a motivator of at least some of the actions is perhaps the desire to foster development of China’s capital market by restricting overseas listings and promote Hong Kong as the preferred “offshore, but domestic” capital market. We will come back to this important topic later. 

These whys are broadly aligned with bigger policy goals articulated at the 19th Party Congress in 2017, during which “Xi Jinping thought” was enshrined, with its emphasis on “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” The three broad goals that we believe are relevant here deal with the negative externalities associated with China’s breakneck growth over the past few decades: environment, equity, geopolitics. And of course, each of these dovetails nicely with industrial policy goals which have been developed to cope with these challenges.  

Environment. We have witnessed enormous strides to improve environmental sustainability in China over the past five years. These include supply side interventions to control production of heavy industry, including steel, coal, cement and mining. And efforts to aggressively promote expansion of renewables, electrification of transportation (electric vehicles and components) and increase ultra-high-voltage power distribution. These are also industrial policy priorities for industries of the future.  
Equality. Policymakers are contending with social frustrations around fairness and social mobility, which are, like everywhere, challenges to the legitimacy of the state. To improve equality of opportunity, China has been working ambitiously on housing, education, health care, pensions and insurance.
Geopolitics. The third goal is national security in a world that China perceives to be increasingly hostile to its rise. Policymakers are trying to remediate perceived external dependencies. The three most important of these, in our view, are dependence on oil, semiconductors, and the US dollar as the dominant currency for its trade. 

Now for the third set of questions. Let us consider the existential threats a little deeper.  
We believe there has been an existential change in policy vision over the past few years in China. The current leadership in Beijing sees the world with a different lens than its predecessors of the post-Mao Zedong era. There appears to be an increasingly held belief in China that the West is simultaneously failing and wants to contain China’s rise. The belief is that the United States, in particular, is fatigued from its international obligations following costly interventions in the Middle East and Central Asia. And that the Great Financial Crisis, the COVID pandemic and the costs of these failed interventions have exposed deep structural and cultural problems in the West. In essence, this belief leads to the view that the United States is once again turning inwards, leaving a vacuum in geopolitics. There is also a belief that the liberal-oriented system developed post WWII is increasingly less accommodating to the rise of China as the United States, its sponsor, faces relative decline.  
China is suspicious (perhaps correctly) that the West’s ultimate policy goals are containment and transformation, and that Western policymakers will not accommodate what they see as a non-liberal player for global influence. Thus, China needs to redress its vulnerabilities, which are oil, semiconductors and the US dollar.  

Oil. China is not a resource-endowed country. Therefore, the electrification of transportation and the move towards renewables is not just for environmental goals but for national security and sovereignty.
Semiconductors. Semiconductors and underlying technology components are controlled principally by America and partially by Japan and, therefore, there is a very deep agenda for China to try to gain independence in this space.
Dollar. China wants companies to retreat to China, principally to Hong Kong, which although offshore, is a domestic market. While China is the most important trading nation in the world, the US dollar is the reserve currency and almost all international transactions are intermediated with US dollars. The dominance and potential weaponization of the US dollar creates a perceived national security challenge. This contributes to China’s desire to develop a deep liquid capital market to encourage trading partners to adopt the renminbi (RMB) as a transactional currency.

Q. China is unique, but is it a capitalist system? 
We are all quite frustrated as investors with the unpredictability that accompanies this dizzying level of regulatory intervention. But we have also tried to step back and understand better the uniqueness of China.  
China’s economy is a hybrid model, a form of political capitalism that is not entirely uncommon in the world — it has parallels with development in much of Asia in the twentieth century (South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia). China’s model today is deeply embedded in thousands of years of political and cultural development of the nation. It is a model that accommodates capitalist enterprise embedded in a highly paternal state. It is a model — as Branco Milanovic articulates well in the book Capitalism Alone — designed to be managed by an independent state run by an efficient, technocratic bureaucracy.  
The first principle is that state autonomy is extremely high and unlikely to change. Rule of law is ambiguous by design, which allows the state to navigate free from legal constraint and can result in capricious policy. However, its goal — and its legitimacy — is ultimately inclusive growth.  
But China is decisively a capitalist economy. The private sector is dominant in production, employment and growth. Capitalism is deeply embedded in China. The private sector, which is encouraged by the government, is vibrant and is the source of growth and innovation in the economy. However, it is a hybrid model where the state provides efficient delivery of public goods that enable development (infrastructure) and balance externalities (inclusive growth).  
Q. Will China experience the middle-income growth trap common to other emerging economies? 
The notion of a “middle-income trap” for emerging economies refers to the difficulty of navigating development away from the low-hanging fruit of labor absorption and deepening capital intensity (typically from farms to factories) and toward higher value-added, more highly productive service industries. The World Bank coined this term 15 years ago to account for observable failure in most developing economies to break out of $10,000 to $12,000 per capita incomes across much of Latin America and Asia.  
This idea has been a recurrent theme among China skeptics and is often conflated with China’s demographic challenge. But China is really different, in our view. And the regulations — or perhaps more appropriately “reforms” — in China over the past few weeks are efforts by policymakers to ensure that China remains different, overcoming the middle-income trap common to many developing countries.  
The middle-income trap is misunderstood by most. The real mistake is one of statistics. Most developing countries’ middle-income trap is fundamentally a function of dual-sector models that are characterized by a relatively small group of efficient formal sector workers who drive economic growth and an overwhelming majority of informal sector labor workers who are trapped in low-skilled or unskilled “mom and pop” industries with almost zero structural growth. The middle-income trap is thus a function of an absence of social mobility, or the inability of these countries to deliver “inclusive growth.” The statistical mistake is that median incomes grow slowly because the supermajority of developing country populations do not grow in real terms, while the small middle classes in these countries grow far more rapidly but cannot pull the entire nation forward.  
In contrast, China is the only country on earth that has been able to sustain high levels of growth, and inclusive growth, over the past three decades. The country has literally birthed 300-400 million middle income consumers during this period of time.2 It is now struggling to deliver similar outcomes for the rest of China’s population over the next few decades. The Xi administration is trying to simultaneously deal with the instabilities of the past few decades — environmental, equity, geopolitical risks — while ensuring financial stability and inclusive growth. If it delivers such inclusive growth, we believe China will avoid the middle-income trap — and our bet is that it will be successful in that endeavor. 
Q. Are Chinese equities still investable? 
Despite feeling downcast about the considerable retreat in a number of our Chinese holdings, we believe considerable opportunities for investors still exist in China, and these should not be dismissed out of hand. Those opportunities exist in a few buckets. 

Alongside this broader policy imperative of “inclusive growth,” we see continued opportunities in the consumer sector. We have large holdings in structural growth industries like hotels, restaurants, and luxury goods. In our view, these are thriving industries prone to consolidation by leading players.  
Second, we believe there are significant long-tailed opportunities in China’s life sciences and health care industries. These also fit within China’s policy priorities to improve inclusive growth, redress significant unmet medical needs across the population, and build global leadership in next-generation segments of drug innovation and manufacturing. There are, in our view, many parallels between the life science industry in China today and where China’s dominant internet companies were a decade ago. Like the internet leaders of the past, many drug developers are borrowing models (clinical assets, targets, in-licensing) from the West that are being adopted for China’s very large drug market. Given the enormous advantages China has in terms of talent (chemistry, biology, engineering) and capital, we expect these companies to aggressively invest early cash flows into real life sciences innovation (bi-specifics, antibody drug conjugates, gene therapy, mRNA vaccines and therapies, bioinformatics, health care tech). We believe we will see a number of companies emerge as leading global players across the life sciences industry over the next decade.  
Finally, we do not dismiss the prospects that many of China’s leading tech companies can find new balance and prove to be excellent investment opportunities here, after big declines. A few months back, Tencent, Meituan, Pinduoduo, and many other leading Chinese businesses were perceived to have a bright future, with a profitable earnings track ahead of them. Many of these stocks are now down 30% to 50%. So, the first question to try to answer is — has the earnings power of these tech platforms reduced by 30% to 50%? If not, how much has sentiment played a role in this market direction? When the question is framed like that, we see a lot of hope and indeed opportunities.  The second question specific to China tech is — what good could come out of regulation? Over the last decade, we have seen several instances of destructive competition with profitability under competitive attack thanks to subsidies, price wars, and mis-directed investments. We have seen prolonged battles for market share that seemed illogical, especially in markets where there were just a few players left — as with fintech, food delivery, and parts of logistics. In the future of China tech, we sense some sanity. Under regulatory pressure, some rationality could come back in the way these economic decisions are taken. As investors, we might see very positive consequences in terms of long-term profitability, steady earnings growth, and a decline in these periodic adrenaline rushes China tech has seen in the past. These could lead to positive investment outcomes.

Q. Are you still “uber-bullish” on Chinese equities? And if so, why? 
We still very much believe that China is in the early stages of what will potentially be one of the great bull markets in human history. That bull market really does not have much to do with “tourists” in Chinese equities, i.e., people who either do not have a mandate to invest in emerging market equities or have a shallow understanding of the nuances of investing in China.  
The bull market in China will be structural, in our view, for several reasons.  

First, we expect China to remain the dominant source of global growth for much of the next decade. China is expected to, in our estimate, create average annual economic growth of approximately US$1 trillion per year over the next three to five years. To put this in perspective, we expect China’s growth to generate economic output the size of Mexico plus Saudi Arabia plus Vietnam over the next three years. In our view, China is an unstoppable growth engine.  
Second, as we have written previously, China’s enormous savings pool is expected to be increasingly diversified toward equities and away from real estate (given policy constraints) and liquid, risk-free assets. And China’s household wealth is enormous, given high savings rates. According to Credit Suisse estimates, total household wealth in China has risen 21x since the turn of the century to US$78 trillion.3  
Thirdly, there are investment opportunities, in our view, that are intricately aligned with policymakers’ goals of inclusive growth, including health care, consumer staples and consumer discretionary industries.  
Finally, there will be beneficiaries of the new regulatory landscape as well within China tech too, which currently appears most impacted by regulatory intervention. And valuations are now, in our view, attractive for long-term performers in the Chinese internet space. 

Q. What are your thoughts on emerging market equities more broadly? 
Emerging market equities have had a very difficult period over the past decade. As of the end of June 2021, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index had a 3.6% compound annual growth rate over the past 10 years in USD terms, compared with 15.4% for the US S&P 500 Index and 6.1% for the MSCI EAFE Index.4 The retreat of China has stalled emerging market (EM) performance over the past 12 months as well. While the S&P 500 Index generated 36.5% trailing 12 months returns and MSCI EAFE Index has delivered 30.3%, the MSCI EM Index has only given 19.7% returns during this period.5 
This shocking underperformance is anomalous in a climate where global rates are extremely low, commodity prices have surged, and the dollar has been in modest decline. It is most unusual.  
The culprits have clearly been the “2C” – China and COVID. Regulatory anxieties in China have risen at a time when COVID-19 continues to inhibit a recovery in many developing countries that have not been able to access vaccinations.  
We have discussed at length our positive views on China and Chinese equities above. The bottom line is we continue to see a solid case for a structural boom in Chinese equities. And we believe that countries across Latin America, Southeast Asia and the rest of the developing world will eventually see a sharp economic recovery post-pandemic. And with recovery, we expect a strong rally in non-China earnings and equity prices. It is also worth reiterating that we believe the “energy transition” of the next decade will be supportive to elevated commodity prices (both mining and energy) and commodity currencies. In our view, the case for favorable returns in EM equities remains strong.

While real estate has long been an important asset class for insurers, investing in this sector requires far more than a one-size-fits-all approach. We conducted a brief survey with 120 insurers, across various insurance company types and sizes, skewing to the larger end of the market (see p.17 for the complete picture of the respondents). What we discovered offers a realistic view as well as an optimistic perspective.

Key takeaways
The global economy remains in expansion, but a near-term peak in the cycle is increasingly likely
Leading economic indicators for the major regions around the world are peaking at the same time global risk appetite is stabilizing at what we think are cyclical highs.
We believe these transitions at the peak of the growth cycle are notoriously unstable
While we believe the early-cycle reflation trade is not exhausted, it appears to be approaching its last stages.
Emerging market (EM) equities have continued to underperform over the past month
Tightening EM financial conditions, slower vaccination progress, and China’s recent regulatory crackdown have put pressure on EM equities.

The global economy remains in expansion, but a near-term peak in the cycle is increasingly likely, as evidenced by some shifting dynamics in the relative performance between sectors, regions, and factors.
We have reduced our stance in developed ex-US equities to neutral in our Global Tactical Asset Allocation model,1 while maintaining an overweight exposure to emerging market equities after the sell-off of the past few months. The market impact from Chinese regulatory interventions has slowed but not derailed global market sentiment, while cheaper asset prices may now respond favorably to future monetary and fiscal support. 
Macro update 
Leading economic indicators for the major regions around the world are peaking (Figures 1 and 2) at the same time global risk appetite is stabilizing at what we think are cyclical highs. Our macro regime framework remains in an expansionary regime, but it is increasingly flagging the potential for an inflection point in the next few months. In our opinion, these transitions at the peak of the growth cycle are notoriously unstable, characterized by range-bound price action in asset prices and shifting themes, with overall positive performance for risky assets. While we believe the early-cycle reflation trade is not exhausted, it is approaching its last stages as evidenced by the recent pullback in the performance of value relative to growth, the performance of small-caps and mid-caps relative to large-cap equities, and the meaningful rally in long-term bond yields.

Institutional investors have become accustomed to low yield in some areas of fixed income they have historically depended upon. This is hardly news, and Invesco’s 2021 Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions  anticipates that yields are likely to stay low. This expectation and investors’ need to meet return objectives in a challenging environment are driving a trend of investment “barbelling,” a not-so-new concept that has been reconsidered, reimagined, and recast to face the challenges confronted by today’s institutional investors.
The barbell concept – a portfolio construction that focuses roughly half of allocations on near-term tactical investments and the remaining half on longer-term assets – is familiar to most investors, but effectively implementing this approach is not as simple as the visual image it calls to mind. It requires substantial investment expertise and resources, but it’s a hot topic at the moment because it allows for tremendous flexibility and the incorporation of two things that institutions find very appealing: private market investments and next level, customizable index investing that seeks returns beyond while also reducing costs (and perhaps contributing to the risk budget allocated to private markets).
Alternatives: Critical for growth optimization and income
In 2019, private market asset capitalization grew to nearly $6 trillion,1 a clear a sign as possible that with traditional public assets burdened by underwhelming return expectations institutional investors are looking for alternatives in every sense of the word. The huge surge of institutional capital is flowing into increasingly complex and nuanced private markets that are anything but standardized – but that does not deter investors, nor should it, says Neil Blundell, Head of Global Client Solutions, Head of Alternative Solutions, Invesco.
“If you have an ability to allocate capital to longer-term private market investments, that’s where – across the board – we see a substantial pickup in expected returns relative to traditional asset classes,” Blundell says. “You can potentially tap into more growth, more income, and more diversification. But it’s a whole new world in private markets compared to the days when there were only a few sub-sectors. The private markets landscape has become increasingly complex in terms of the sub-strategies, and asset growth has been exponential. The challenge is that you need significant staff, technology, and infrastructure to effectively navigate the alternative space.”
“Our mantra is to be an extension of staff for the institutional investor. We don’t want to take over. If you’re the head of alternative investments at an institution anywhere in the world, we want to help you invest smarter by providing better research, analytics and access so you can invest like one of the world’s largest institutions.""
-Neil Blundell,
 Head of Global Client Solutions, Head of Alternative Solutions, Invesco 

As the private market space has grown and matured, a multitude of investment opportunities have emerged that may potentially provide attractive risk-adjusted returns and help investors meet a range of objectives. These opportunities include matching liabilities and allowing for more stable cash flows – if investors can effectively access them. The largest institutions may have the staff and resources to comfortably play in private markets, but for other (read: most) institutions, it might appear at first glance to be a bridge too far in terms of time, capacity and human resources. 
“If you’re a mid-sized institution, it’s likely that you are under-allocated to private markets,” says Blundell. “You know it could potentially improve your overarching risk and return profile. But do you have what you need to set up the right asset allocation? Can you access, source and perform proper due diligence on high quality investments? How do you get economies of scale? How will you evaluate opportunities like co-investments, which may reduce the cost of ownership? On top of that, you’re going to need consolidated reporting, monitoring, and risk management for more complex, private investments. Simply put, private markets are not as straightforward to access as the traditional markets.”
Investors are under-allocated and sub-optimized in private markets
Blundell and his Investment Solutions Team at Invesco are constantly pursuing and refining solutions for what might be considered the democratization of private markets, or at the very least the process of creating a more level playing field for institutions of moderate and modest size. The process begins with a close look at investor’s existing portfolio in the context of the current market regime.  
“We start by using our technology to model the assets and liabilities of a client,” says Blundell. “Based on liabilities and cashflow needs, we may look at including additional alternative asset classes to the strategic asset allocation to see if we can improve the efficient frontier. We’ve done a lot of work to model these assets very specifically, so we can begin to quantify what it all means for a client in a very precise way. Typically, we find that most investors are under-allocated and sub-optimized in terms of the alternative asset class exposures within their portfolios, and they may have significant opportunities to enhance their asset allocation.”
It’s easy to envision how overwhelming an unaided venture into private markets might be when you consider the breadth and nuance across each private asset class, as well as region-specific considerations across North America, Europe, and Asia. To the new entrant into the private market space, the due diligence efforts alone may be enough to send heads spinning. Investors want to make informed decisions, of course, but for resource-constrained institutions, kicking off an effort to independently evaluate a new universe of prospective investments may be extremely challenging – and attempting to do so could very well lead to a suboptimal outcome without sufficient expertise in-house. On the other hand, by leveraging the possibilities of another trend sweeping the allocator universe – outsourcing some or all of the allocation process – investors can make private markets decisions leveraging the talent and resources available at a trusted partner, such as Invesco.
The essentials of being in the private market space – customization, exposures, reporting requirements, structuring advice – pile up in a hurry. International investors, for example, must navigate varied tax regulations, which may call for certain investment structures to be in place.
“We want to support our clients by providing the information they need in an understandable way so they can make decisions, and we can customize a solution for them based on those decisions,” says Blundell. “Our mantra is to be an extension of staff for the institutional investor. We don’t want to take over. If you’re the head of alternative investments at an institution anywhere in the world, we want to help you invest smarter by providing better research, analytics and access so you can invest like one of the world’s largest institutions. Our systems have modeled out private markets in a unique and specific way, which has taken a great deal of time and effort. We’ve invested significantly in our platform, which allow us to work seamlessly with clients to co-design and implement the most appropriate asset allocation for their unique objectives and constraints.”

Key takeaways
The demand for energy has grown as the economy has re-opened
Global consumption of liquid fuels is projected to grow by 5.3 million barrels per day in 2021.
Investor interest has benefited the broader energy and midstream energy sectors
Despite recent strong performance, the asset class has still traded near historic lows while providing current yield well in excess of competing yielding asset classes.

As the economy has re-opened, demand for energy has increased. Total petroleum consumption was about 13% lower in 2020 than in 2019, but volumes for gasoline consumption have rebounded and are projected to increase by nearly 17% this year compared to 2020.1 In aggregate, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) estimates global liquid fuels consumption will grow by 5.3 million barrels per day (mm b/d) in 2021. Additionally, global consumption of liquid fuels will increase by an additional 3.7 mm b/d in 2022 to 101.4 mm b/d, which would surpass 2019 levels.2

Key takeaways
The Fed foreshadows tapering
Last week saw a lot of Federal Reserve officials foreshadowing about tapering.
The Fed has a starring role
The beauty of foreshadowing when you are a Fed official is that you play an important role in the event coming to fruition.
Would tapering lead to another tantrum?
I believe tapering later this year is a “fait accompli.” However, I don’t believe it will result in anything like the “taper tantrum” we experienced in 2013.

It’s “back to school” season in many parts of the world, which always brings back warm memories for me. When I was in high school, I really enjoyed some of the English classes I took. In addition to reading many of the great classics, I learned about literary devices. One of my favorites has always been foreshadowing: “a literary device used to give an indication or hint of what is to come later in the story. Foreshadowing is useful for creating suspense, a feeling of unease, a sense of curiosity, or a mark that things may not be as they seem.”1 
Foreshadowing can be simple — think of the tense music that foreshadows a shark attack in “Jaws.” It can be direct — for example, when the witches predicted the ascension of Macbeth as king in Shakespeare’s play. It can be indirect — a crow flying across the sky to forewarn viewers about a death. And don’t forget, foreshadowing can sometimes be inaccurate — there can be “red herrings” that seem to suggest one thing will happen, but in fact it does not. 
The Fed foreshadows tapering
Foreshadowing isn’t limited to books and movies. Last week saw a lot of Federal Reserve (Fed) officials foreshadowing about tapering. Last Monday, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren made his views on asset purchases clear: “If you continue to purchase assets, the reaction primarily is in pricing, not so much in employment. I don’t think asset purchases are having the desired impact on really promoting employment.”2  Rosengren suggested that tapering will begin soon: “I would expect if we continue to have (jobs) reports like we’ve had over the last two, with very substantial payroll employment gains, that by the September meeting, we would, in my view, meet the substantial further progress criteria, and that would imply starting to taper sometime this fall.”2 
In a speech last week, Kansas City Fed President Esther George also foreshadowed tapering soon. “Today’s tight economy … certainly does not call for a tight monetary policy, but it does signal that the time has come to dial back the settings.”3 She was confident in her assessment: “Now with the recovery underway, a transition from extraordinary monetary policy accommodation to more neutral setting MUST follow.”3 
This is just a sampling of some recent comments from Fed officials. The previous week, Vice Chair Richard Clarida shared that if his “base case” outlook for the economy is realized, then he would support a tapering announcement later this year. 
The Fed has a starring role in this narrative
The beauty of foreshadowing when you are a Fed official is that you play an important role in the event coming to fruition. Not only can you vote on it, but you can try to persuade your colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to vote the same way. Last week, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan explained his perspective: “It would be my view that if the economy unfolds between now and our September meeting ... if it unfolds the way I expect, I would be in favor of announcing a plan at the September meeting and beginning tapering in October.”4 He echoed what we have heard from other members of the FOMC: “The reason I’m saying we ought to begin the tapering soon is I think these purchases are very well equipped to stimulate demand. But we don’t have a demand problem in the economy. My thought is I’d rather take the foot off the accelerator soon and reduce the RPMs. What I don’t want to do is keeping running at this speed for too long and then we’re going to have to take more aggressive action down the road.”4
Would tapering lead to another tantrum?
I believe tapering later this year is a “fait accompli.” However, I don’t believe it will result in anything like the “taper tantrum” we experienced in 2013. That’s because the Fed has learned from that experience how to better communicate policy normalization before it begins.
Looking back on 2013, FOMC minutes show that the Fed was talking about tapering since its January 2013 meeting. At its April/May meeting, some FOMC members indicated interest in starting tapering at the June meeting — but nothing was publicly communicated at that time. Therefore, Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s tapering comments on May 22, 2013, in response to a question from a member of Congress, was like dropping a bombshell — no real foreshadowing had occurred in advance. Needless to say, playwright Anton Chekhov, who counseled that “if there is a rifle onstage in the first act, then it absolutely must go off in the second or third act,”5 would have been as disappointed as markets were in Mr. Bernanke’s lack of foreshadowing.

Fast forward to today. This time could not be more different. The Fed has been overly transparent about tapering, starting earlier this year when it revealed that it hadn’t even started to talk about talking about tapering. This year we have been treated to a buffet of “Fedspeak” around tapering as thinking and deliberation evolved, so much so that many may have “taper talk fatigue” — eager to rip the Band-Aid off and get started just so they don’t have to hear any more about it. I also appreciate the efforts of Fed officials to bifurcate tapering from rate hikes, treating the two policy tools as very separate. I believe that should also help to calm markets.

Conclusion

It feels like a fall taper is a fait accompli with an announcement by September. We might get some volatility — even a short-term sell-off if combined with more negative news about COVID-19 and its impact on global growth. But thanks to heavy foreshadowing by Fed officials, I believe markets will be well-prepared for such a decision, and that we should avoid anything like the 2013 taper tantrum.

Key takeaways
In July, midstream equities experienced their first down month since September 2020
Despite the strong recovery year-to-date, midstream equities continue to trade well below long-term valuation norms.
Midstream MLPs and affiliates did not raise any new marketed equity or debt during July
MLPs and affiliates announced $0.3 billion of new asset acquisitions over the month.
Second-quarter reporting season began in July
Operating performance has been, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA coming in higher than consensus estimates.

July brought the first down month for midstream equities since September 2020. Despite the strong recovery year-to-date, midstream equities continue to trade well below long-term valuation norms. The five largest sector participants have grown EBITDA per share/unit by 15% since the downcycle began in 2014 but their stock prices are 55% lower.
MLP market overview

Midstream MLPs, as measured by the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), ended July down 7.1% on a price basis and down 6.4% after distributions are considered. The AMZ underperformed the S&P 500 Index’s 2.4% total return for the month. The best-performing midstream subsector for July was the Propane group, while the Marine subsector underperformed, on average.

For the year through July, the AMZ is up 31.5% on a price basis, resulting in a 38.3% total return. This compares to the S&P 500 Index’s 17.0% and 18.0% price and total returns, respectively. The Gathering and Processing group has produced the best average total return year-to-date, while the Natural Gas Pipeline subsector has lagged.

MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-Year US Treasury Bond, widened by 75 basis points (bps) over the month, exiting the period at 658 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 692 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 428 bps. The AMZ distribution yield at month-end was 7.8%.

Midstream MLPs and affiliates did not raise any new marketed equity (common or preferred, excluding at-the-market programs) or debt during the month. MLPs and affiliates announced $0.3 billion of new asset acquisitions over the month.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil exited the month at $73.95 per barrel, up 0.7% over the period and 83.6% higher year-over-year. Natural gas prices ended July at $3.91 per million British thermal units (MMbtu), up 7.2% over the month and 117.6% higher than July 2020. Natural gas liquids (NGL) priced at Mont Belvieu exited the month at $39.58 per barrel, 5.3% higher than the end of June and 110.8% higher than the year-ago period.

News

Second-quarter earnings season commences. Second-quarter reporting season began in July. Through month-end, 42 midstream entities had announced distributions for the quarter, including seven distribution increases, two reductions, and 33 distributions that were unchanged from the previous quarter. Through the end of July, 11 sector participants had reported second-quarter financial results. Operating performance has been, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, coming in 2.2% higher than consensus estimates but 17.6% lower than the preceding quarter (which included certain benefits from the price dislocations associated with Winter Storm Uri).

Plains and Oryx join forces in the Permian. Plains All American (NYSE: PAA/PAGP) and Oryx Midstream Holdings LLC (Private) announced an agreement to merge their respective assets, operations, and commercial activities within the Permian Basin into a newly formed strategic joint venture, Plains Oryx Permian Basin. The transaction will include all of Oryx's Permian assets and, with the exception of Plains' long-haul pipeline systems and certain of its intra-basin terminal assets, the vast majority of Plains' assets located within the Permian Basin. The joint venture provides for an overall ownership and distribution sharing arrangement of 65% Plains and 35% Oryx.

Kinder buys in to renewable natural gas. Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) announced the acquisition of Kinetrex Energy, a leading supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the Midwest and a rapidly growing player in producing and supplying renewable natural gas (RNG) under long-term contracts to transportation service providers. Kinetrex has a 50% interest in the largest RNG facility in Indiana as well as signed commercial agreements to begin construction on three additional landfill-based RNG facilities. RNG is derived from abundant renewable sources, including organic waste in landfills, wastewater treatment plants, and agricultural operations. By capturing methane produced from the decomposition of organic waste, the RNG production process reduces or eliminates greenhouse gas emissions.

Chart of the month: Growth in the down cycle

Since the energy market down cycle began in 2014, key midstream sector participants have demonstrated their ability to continue to generate cash flow growth, but the financial markets valuations of the sector remain depressed. 
In the chart below we compare the expected EBITDA per share or unit for the five largest publicly traded midstream companies in 2022 versus the same figure in 2014 and see that these companies were able to grow EBITDA per share from their business by an average of 15% over the period. However, at month-end the equity prices for these companies are, on average, 55% lower than mid-2014.

Key takeaways
Are markets headed for a tantrum?
As the Fed foreshadows the possibility of dialing back its economic support, investors are concerned about a repeat of 2013’s “taper tantrum.”
The Fed has adjusted its style
This time around, the Fed appears to be moving gingerly so as not to scare the markets and choke off the recovery.
Remember that tantrums are temporary
I would view any type of outburst as a rite of passage along the way to this cycle maturing into a more stable one.

I haven’t heard this much talk about tantrums since I had toddlers running around my house. Fortunately, I’ve graduated from having children who cry, wail, and throw themselves on the ground for little discernable reason — but now I find myself in a business cycle that is still young and potentially prone to outbursts. I find myself asking the same questions now as I did back in my earlier parenting days: “Are tantrums inevitable? Or can they be avoided?” 
Remembering the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’
To keep the analogy going, in the last business cycle (2009-2019), the infamous “taper tantrum” occurred as the US Federal Reserve began to fuss less over the economy despite the market’s concerns that the economy wasn’t yet ready for the Fed to take away the pacifier. The market staged its own version of a public meltdown: US interest rates spiked, credit spreads widened, equities sold off, and all things emerging markets plummeted.1
Today, as the Fed foreshadows the possibility of dialing back its support for an expanding economy, those who remember the last tantrum are wondering if we’re headed for another.
The calm before the storm?
The worst part about tantrums, as all parents can attest, is that you never know when they are coming. There’s a lot of speculation that another tantrum may be on the horizon. The markets had appeared to be relatively sanguine over the possibility of the Fed beginning to scale down its asset purchases. Even this week’s CNBC headline, “There’s Growing Support Within the Fed to Announce the Tapering of Bond Purchases in September,” didn’t send the markets into hysterics. US equities, as represented by the S&P 500 Index, closed Monday at an all-time high.2
By Wednesday, the S&P 500 Index had fallen by 1.7% from its high.3 Had this been just the proverbial calm before the storm? That moment when you’re enjoying your sweet, lovable toddler right before they start hitting, kicking, and ignoring rules?  
Not necessarily. Sometimes it’s just easier with the second child — er, business cycle. For one, we learn a thing or two along the way about preventing tantrums. As a first-time parent, my methods for trying to resolve a situation (“stop it,” “you’re fine,” “get over it”) would only exacerbate things. By the second time around, I had learned that simply affirming what the child is feeling (“you’re mad,” “I know that hurts,” “I’m sad for you”) is a far-better, almost magical, approach. 
The Fed adjusts its communication style
Similarly, the US Federal Reserve also appears to have altered its approach. In May 2013, then-Chairman Ben Bernanke surprised the market by saying that the Fed could “step down” the pace of asset purchases “in the next few meetings.” While there was no suggestion of a change in interest rate policy, the market nonetheless repriced its expectation for the future path of short-term interest rates 1% to 4% by mid-2015.4 It was like a parent telling a child that it’s time to leave the playground with no advance warning — that tends not to go over very well. 
This time, the Fed appears to have learned its lesson. We joke that the Fed, instead of announcing the tapering of asset purchases, has been “talking about, talking about tapering asset purchases.” The Fed appears to be moving gingerly so as not to scare the markets and tighten financial conditions, and thereby choke off the recovery. Thus far the market is pricing in only a very gradual rise in the federal funds rate over the next two years.5 Language matters in dealing with children and markets.
Today’s cycle isn’t like the last one
Second, sometimes you just get lucky with the fundamental construct of the child or business cycle. My second daughter was less prone to tantrum. It’s just the way she was built. In my view, the same can likely be said about this cycle:

This time, inflation expectations are modestly elevated. In 2013, the world was still awash in the disinflationary impulses that had emerged in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The Fed was struggling to maintain inflation expectations (represented by the 2-year US Treasury breakeven) at the 2% target.6 The Fed’s proposed adjustment to its balance sheets in 2013 appeared to be in response to the Fed’s anticipation of future inflation, rather than in response to realized inflation or the market’s expectations for inflation.

Conversely, the Consumer Price Index is currently well above the pre-COVID peak7 and inflation expectations are above the Fed’s 2% target.8 As a result, it is less likely now than it was in 2013 that an indication of tighter policy would be viewed as the policy mistake that would send the US dollar higher and risk assets lower.
Many of the “fragile” emerging market countries aren’t as fragile as they once were. In 2013, the emerging market countries suffered significant capital flight as the Fed indicated its intent to taper asset purchases. At the time, many emerging market countries were running high current account deficits as their imports were far exceeding their exports.9 These countries had strong dependence on foreign inflows to finance consumption. As a result, they had acute vulnerability to currency fluctuations, resulting from their large volumes of foreign-currency debt.

The current account picture is much different as these countries, like the US, have been consuming less and saving more. Moreover, the flow of capital into emerging markets over the past years is nowhere near as large as it was in the years prior to 2013.

With external financing needs much lower and likely to remain suppressed as the pandemic continues to weigh on EM-domestic demand, I believe it is unlikely that EM assets will experience anything like the taper tantrum of 2013.

Conclusion
Just like all kids are different, so too are all cycles. Do we have to deal with another tantrum? I suppose it’s possible. Market volatility tends to occur with changes in policy. Again, you just never know with children or business cycles in the early stages of development. More importantly, I would view any type of outburst as developmentally appropriate and just a rite of passage along the way to this cycle maturing into a more stable one.

Key takeaways
The US economy has been growing quickly
We expect the US economy to return to its pre-pandemic growth trend by the end of the year.
A near-term bump in inflation is likely
We are likely to see higher inflation in the next two quarters than we have seen for some time.
The inflation outlook for 2022 is harder to predict
In our view, the key thing to watch over the next year to gauge the likelihood of persistent inflation will be wages.

The US economy has been growing at a remarkable pace, as consumers engage in a post-pandemic return to a more normal life.  Invesco Fixed Income believes this is likely to continue throughout this year and we expect the US economy to grow more than 7% for 2021 in its entirety – this would be a remarkable outcome, driven by aggressive policy support and the inspirational work to quickly develop a vaccine.  We expect the US economy to surpass its 2019 size in the second quarter and return to its pre-pandemic growth trend by the end of this year.
It is increasingly looking like 2022 will also be a year of strong growth, as fiscal and monetary policy are expected to keep pushing the economy forward.  If growth has returned to trend and the economy has achieved full employment by the end of this year (which we expect), shouldn’t strong growth next year generate inflation?  If not then, when?

Brian Watson
Senior Portfolio Manager
Key takeaways
Over the past 30 years, global energy demand has roughly doubled, driven by quality of life advances within developing nations
While renewables and electric vehicles are likely to contribute to developing world energy demand, the cost, logistical, and reliability advantages of traditional fuels remain substantial.
Many midstream providers have already benefited from existing and emerging emission reduction efforts
For example, the use of biofuels and hydrogen is likely to increase, and several large carbon capture projects have recently been announced.
Recent data shows that demand for refined products has finally recovered to pre-COVID levels
We expect many midstream companies to generate substantial free cash flow that can be invested in new technologies and infrastructure to help lead the energy transition.

We recently wrote about the growing demand for energy and what that means for midstream investors. Though it appears the midstream sector’s free cash flow dynamics have begun to attract investor interest over recent quarters, business and governmental efforts to reduce carbon emissions have others worried about the longer-term outlook for midstream asset cash flows. 
Of course, a comprehensive review of net zero policies and technologies (and an assessment of the potential efficacy or shortcomings of these efforts) is beyond the scope of this article. However, it is important to consider these dynamics within context.

First, since the US has emerged as one of the globe’s largest energy exporters, we believe the outlook for US midstream volumes, in total, will be driven by global consumption. Second, the outlook for any specific midstream asset or company is often disconnected from such macro dynamics. 

The macro

Over the past 30 years, global energy demand has roughly doubled, driven by quality of life advances within developing nations. To meet this need, between 1980 to 2018, global crude oil production increased 60%, natural gas production increased 158%, and coal production increased 112%.1 

Looking forward, most energy analysts expect developing nation energy demand to continue to expand significantly. The forecasted pace of this expansion varies amongst prognosticators, of course; no one has a crystal ball. However, we know that quality of life disparity between developing and developed nations remains wide. For example, over one-third of the earth’s population still lacks access to clean cooking, primarily relying on biomass.2 While roughly 840 out of every 1,000 US citizens has a vehicle, this ratio falls to 200 per 1,000 in China, and only 41 per 1,000 in India. Consider too that the US population is only 330 million compared to China’s 1.40 billion and India’s 1.37 billion.3 

Said differently, global energy demand currently runs at 70,000 terawatt-hours per annum (TWH); around half of that total can be attributed to 1.4 billion people in the developed world, and the other half can be attributed to 6.3 billion in the emerging world.4 The latter group will likely drive energy consumption trends going forward.

While renewables and electric vehicles (EVs) are likely to contribute to developing world energy demand, the cost, logistical, and reliability advantages of traditional fuels remain substantial. Therefore, traditional fuels will likely be an integral contributor to achieving affordable quality of life improvement within developing nations.

Further, few believe global crude oil and natural gas production could grow 60% and 158%, respectively, from today’s levels, as was achieved over the previous 30 years. Additionally, even some developing nations are attempting to limit their reliance on coal for power generation, resulting in a more pronounced reliance on natural gas and renewables relative to history. 

For example, SIA Energy, a natural gas consultant, recently projected China gas demand will double between 2020 and 2040. Notably, coal accounts for 58% of China’s primary energy mix versus less than 10% for natural gas currently. In fact, if countries across the globe converted from coal use to natural gas, that alone could reduce up to 1.2 gigatons of CO2 emissions, the equivalent of removing 260 million cars from the road.5

Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
Some Fed officials took a hawkish tone
At Jackson Hole, several Federal Reserve officials were emphatic that tapering needs to begin – and soon.
Powell’s remarks calmed markets
But Powell offered a kinder, gentler view of tapering, declining to establish a timeline.
No rush on rate hikes
Powell also noted that rate hikes have a more stringent set of conditions and are uncoupled from tapering plans.

Last week — in the dead of August — the Kansas City Fed held its annual Jackson Hole Symposium. In a true sign of the times, the symposium was not actually held in Jackson Hole this year, as had been originally planned; instead, it was held virtually. This underscored the reality that things are not back to normal.
Some Fed officials took a hawkish tone
In the run-up to Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell’s speech, several Fed officials were emphatic that tapering needs to begin soon. Kansas City Fed President Esther George said she expects the Fed to start tapering shortly. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan called for tapering to be announced by September and to begin by October or soon thereafter. Perhaps most surprising — and most hawkish — were the words of St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
Bullard worried that the Fed’s balance sheet expansion is creating a housing bubble. He said that the tapering process should be finished by the end of the first quarter. What’s more, he articulated serious concerns about inflation; he seems skeptical that inflation is actually transitory and argued that by March 2022, the Fed would be able to assess whether inflation had moderated. He suggested that if inflation hadn’t moderated, the Fed would have to get “more aggressive,” which I would presume to mean rate hikes, and that would be sooner than expected. Not surprisingly, these hawkish comments rattled markets.
Powell’s remarks calmed markets
But then came Powell’s speech, and markets breathed a sigh of relief.  It’s true that things are certainly not back to normal, and Powell made that clear. He recognized that the pace of the recovery has exceeded expectations — and has been far swifter than the recovery from the Great Recession, with even employment gains having come faster than expected. However, he underscored the unusual nature of the recovery – he described it as “historically anomalous” -- with personal income actually having risen. He said that while labor conditions had improved significantly, they were still “turbulent.” And of course he pointed out that the economic recovery is being threatened by the resurgence of the pandemic.
Powell also underscored the unevenness of the economic recovery, that the Americans least able to carry the burden are the ones who have had to do just that. He emphasized that the services sector has been disproportionately affected, noting that total employment “is now 6 million below its February 2020 level, and 5 million of that shortfall is in the still-depressed service sector.”1
A kinder, gentler tapering
While George, Kaplan and Bullard took a more hawkish stance on tapering, Powell offered a kinder, gentler view. He recognized that the “substantial further progress” test for inflation had been met, but did not announce the start of tapering, or even call for it to be announced by September. He acknowledged that at the July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, most participants believed it would be appropriate to taper this year. And he recognized that in the month since the last FOMC meeting, there has been more progress on the economic front — but that there has also been further spread of the COVID-19 Delta variant. My read on this is that tapering is likely to be announced soon, but that Powell would like to maintain some flexibility given the uncertainties presented by COVID.
Powell seemed more certain in his assessment that inflation is largely transitory. He offered up compelling arguments to support that view, especially pointing to longer-term inflation expectations remaining anchored. I found this gave credibility to his more dovish stance.
The key takeaway: A ‘conscious uncoupling’
Powell channeled his inner Gwyneth Paltrow in asserting that rate hikes are uncoupled from tapering. In other words, he suggested that we shouldn’t expect rate hikes to begin just because tapering has ended. He asserted that rate hikes have a different and far more stringent test: “until the economy reaches conditions consistent with maximum employment and the economy is on track to reach 2% inflation on a sustainable basis.”1 This was perhaps the most important takeaway from the speech, given that markets seem far more concerned with when rate hikes will begin rather than when tapering will begin.
Looking ahead
All eyes will be on the August jobs report, due out at the end of this week. There are whispers that this could be a blowout with more than 1 million non-farm payrolls created. If that happens, I believe the Fed would be even more comfortable announcing tapering in September and starting to taper in October.
Further off into the distance, questions are swirling about whether Powell will be re-nominated as Fed Chair. While I suspect there may be a little grumbling from the extremes on both aisles of Congress, my money is on his re-nomination. However, speculation about this — and the future of the vice chairs (the vice chair and the vice chair for supervision) — will certainly occupy some markets watchers’ time in the coming months.

Invesco Fixed Income

Key takeaways
The debt ceiling was suspended two years ago, but that agreement expired on July 31
Effective Aug. 1, 2021, the debt limit was reset to the previous ceiling of $22 trillion — plus $6.5 trillion in additional borrowing for intragovernmental holdings.
This has important market implications for yields on short-term money market securities
Until Congress enacts legislation to either suspend or increase the debt limit, we expect the downward pressure on yields to intensify across the Treasury bill curve.
The Treasury may leverage its “toolkit” of extraordinary measures to avoid breaching its debt limit
By limiting the amount of outstanding debt, these measures provide vital borrowing room to provide the Treasury with approximately $350 billion in borrowing capacity.

After two years out of the spotlight, the debt ceiling has retaken center stage. The debt ceiling was suspended two years ago, but that agreement expired on July 31. Now, we consider the market implications of Congress’s next move and the measures the Treasury can take until lawmakers determine the debt ceiling’s future this fall. 
What is the debt ceiling?
The debt ceiling was established by Congress to specify the total amount of debt the Treasury Department may issue (in the form of Treasury securities) to finance government operations. Increasing or suspending the debt limit simply ensures that the Treasury can pay for expenditures that have already been made; it does not increase or authorize future government spending.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 20191 suspended the debt limit for the two-year period that ended on July 31. Effective Aug. 1, 2021, the debt limit was reset to the previous ceiling of $22 trillion — plus $6.5 trillion in additional borrowing for intragovernmental holdings, which include special securities issued to government trust funds like Social Security and the Unemployment Trust Fund — bringing the current ceiling to $28.5 trillion.2
Implications for money market yields
This has important market implications for yields on short-term money market securities, which have been driven down recently by market supply-demand dynamics. The supply-demand mismatch has been caused by an increase in money market fund assets under management of approximately $192 billion, versus a decline in Treasury bill supply in the amount of $855.1 billion year-to date.3

Until Congress enacts legislation to either suspend or increase the debt limit, we expect the downward pressure on yields to intensify across the Treasury bill curve as Treasury bills are paid down in the coming months. (Early projections suggest approximately $350 billion in additional Treasury bill paydowns over the next three months if the debt ceiling impasse is not resolved by October.4) As we await action from Congress, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) adjustments to its Interest on Excess Reserves (IOER) and Reverse Repurchase Program (RRP) — both rates were increased by five basis points at the June Federal Open Market Committee meeting — is providing some relief to markets at the front end of the yield curve, lifting rates off the lows seen in the first half of the year. But despite the Fed’s increase in these two benchmark rates, the lack of Treasury supply has allowed Treasury bill yields to trend below the offering rate on the Fed’s RRP (which, in theory, should act as the floor for rates). This dynamic has been a key driver in the increased usage of the Fed’s RRP facility, which we anticipate will remain elevated in the near term.
The Treasury can access its toolkit to avoid breaching the debt limit
To fund its short-term commitments without breaching the debt limit, we expect the Treasury to draw from its “toolkit” of extraordinary measures to create additional borrowing room. These measures include: 

Suspending investments in the Thrift Savings Plan’s G Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund.
Suspending the issuance of new securities for the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund (PSRHBF). 
Redeem, in advance, securities held by the CSRDF and PSRHBF in amounts equal in value to upcoming benefit payments and exchange Treasury securities held by the CSRDF with Federal Financing Bank securities (which do not count against the debt limit).4

By limiting the amount of outstanding debt, these measures provide vital borrowing room to provide the Treasury with approximately $350 billion in borrowing capacity as we await congressional action to suspend or increase the debt limit. However, given the heightened uncertainty surrounding payments and receipts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to estimate how long these measures will be effective, given the challenges in accounting for any unforeseen financing needs that may arise over the next few months.
Outlook for the debt ceiling debate and markets
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates “that unless the debt limit is increased, the Treasury, after using all available extraordinary measures, will probably be unable to make its usual payments starting sometime in the first quarter of the new fiscal year, most likely in October or November, although an earlier or later date is possible. After that point, the debt limit would cause delays of payments for government activities, a default on the government’s debt obligations, or both.”4
One noteworthy difference in the current debt ceiling showdown versus past episodes is investors’ willingness to invest in Treasury bill maturities that could be impacted by payment delays, which analysts believe could occur in October or November of this year. While investors have historically avoided maturities with such looming uncertainty, the constrained supply in today’s market environment has forced market participants to be more open to these issues. While investors acknowledge that a default would likely have significant market implications, they believe that neither party wants to risk the political costs of allowing the US to default on its obligations. In other words, they are counting on Congress to take action before the clock runs out. 
We are confident that both sides of the aisle want to avoid the political fallout that a default might bring, and that lawmakers will resolve the issue — at least for now — before default becomes a reality. Congress could negotiate a resolution, but legislation through reconciliation appears to be the most likely pathway, in our view, as it only requires 50 votes to pass and a deal could be packaged with the fiscal budget in September. This scenario would potentially avoid the all too familiar showdown of eleventh-hour debates and elude the worst-case scenario. But we still expect both sides to use the issue as a political football and extend negotiations to the last minute.

Key takeaways
Major tech companies continue to take up a large portion of the US stock market
Some investors are searching for lesser-known opportunities to invest in tech.
Unlike in the US, there are many opportunities among smaller-sized companies for would-be tech investors
We own many global companies that are “analogues” to some familiar names here in the US and follow a similar, relatively rapid growth path.

As the FAANG+Microsoft companies continue to collectively comprise a large portion of US stock market capitalization (20% as of June 30, 2021),1 investors may wonder where to find other opportunities to invest in tech outside of the “usual suspects.”
Here in the US, it often seems as though the best opportunities are either already fully priced, owned by venture capital investors, or bought by the big players before they can offer a competitive threat. But what happens when we look outside of the US? There the picture begins to look somewhat different. And somewhat surprisingly, especially when compared to the US, there are many opportunities among smaller-sized companies. 

Five key tech trends we’re interested in

We have always been attracted to the growth opportunities that the tech sector offers, and we think we are in a particularly exciting period today. We are witnessing an accelerating pace of innovation that is transforming industries, and the products and services they can offer. When we look outside of the US, we see many high-quality, smaller-sized companies that are plays on the key trends associated with “Big Tech,” including AI, big data, e-commerce, the Internet of Things, and so forth. 


Digitalization: Our International Small-Mid Cap strategy is invested in consulting companies in Japan, India, and France that help companies digitize their businesses, a trend that the pandemic has accelerated. 

B2B software: We own several business-to-business (B2B) software companies around the world in niches as varied as asset management, logistics, accounting, automated building management, and client service call centers. All offer their software through the “Software as a Service” model, with its advantages of affordability and easy service upgrades to clients, low-cost delivery, and opportunities for deeper client penetration to the providers. 

E-commerce beneficiaries: We own well-positioned companies that have benefited from the rising demand for e-commerce, such as systems integrators in warehouse and factory automation equipment based in Japan and in Europe. The owner of the most highly regarded automated pick-and-pack technology for fulfillment warehouses in the grocery industry was a key holding for us as it began establishing its global footprint, until its success took it beyond our market capitalization range. 

Semi-conductor-adjacent companies: Semi-conductor manufacturing would seem to be a capital-intensive activity in which only large companies can participate, and yet we own smaller companies that are crucial to the industry. They range from the monopolist supplier of the vacuum seals with the efficacy required for the highest-end clean rooms, to the specialist makers of the highly precise lithography, cutting, and grinding equipment necessary to chip manufacturers. 

“Analogue” apps: We own many companies that are “analogues” to some familiar names here in the US. In their own markets — which have their own idiosyncratic languages, customs, conditions, and regulations — they provide services that mimic those of players here in the US such as Zillow, LinkedIn, and Autotrader, to name just a few, and follow a similar, relatively rapid growth path.


In our opinion, it is well worth our time as investors to look beyond the “usual suspects” for tech opportunities, and the international small-mid asset class is richly populated with them.

In their own markets — which have their own idiosyncratic languages, customs, conditions, and regulations — they provide services that mimic those of players here in the US such as Zillow, LinkedIn, and Autotrader, to name just a few, and follow a similar, relatively rapid growth path.


In our opinion, it is well worth our time as investors to look beyond the “usual suspects” for tech opportunities, and the international small-mid asset class is richly populated with them.

Key takeaways
Investors are wary of September
On the surface, September has been a rough month for stocks over the past 120 years.
A few bad apples had a big impact
A few rough Septembers have played an oversized role in spoiling the month’s reputation.
Recent history tells a different story
In the past three business cycles, September has surpassed its negative reputation.

The band Green Day sang, “Wake me up when September ends.” You can’t blame investors for feeling the same way. Over the past 120 years, September has been the worst month of the year for stocks, both on average and median.1 The media makes certain each year to remind us of this fact. Is there a rational explanation for this seasonal pattern or is it just a statistical anomaly? 
I have heard everything from A) Investors sell stocks when they return from their summer vacations to B) Investors are forced to sell stocks to pay for their children’s college education to C) Mutual fund managers with fiscal years that end in the fall, sell their losers for window-dressing purposes. The last one would be on to something, but for the fact that a wide majority of mutual funds have fiscal years that end in December. And weren’t the investors returning from their summer vacations supposed to have already sold in May before they went away anyway? I’m confused.
The reality is that while average returns in September have been negative (as shown below), it is largely the case of a few bad Septembers (1929, 1930, 1931, 1933, 1937, 1974, 2001, 2002, 2008) spoiling a month’s reputation.1 Each of those Septembers are associated not only with recessions but some of the more spectacular downturns — The Great Depression, 9/11, the collapse of Lehman Brothers — on record.   Those infamous September declines range in severity from a 30% decline in 1931 to a 6% decline in 2008, with the other ones mentioned falling within that range.

Key takeaways
COVID data rattles US consumers
Headlines can have a big impact on sentiment in a short period of time.
Mobility data remains solid
However, I think it is much more informative to look at mobility data than consumer sentiment.
All eyes on Powell’s Jackson Hole speech
I expect the Fed Chair to reiterate that tapering is likely to happen soon and discuss details.

Over the last several weeks, the idea that COVID-19 would soon be a problem of the past was dashed with recent data. Countries such as Israel — which I’ve described as the “gold standard” of vaccine rollouts — and the United States are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 infections. And, as I’ve referenced before, findings released by Israel last month indicated a growing decline in the infection protection of the Pfizer vaccine over time: While protection against infection for those who were vaccinated in April was at 75%, that figure fell to 16% for those who received their vaccination in January.1 The good news is that the vaccine remained very effective in protecting against serious illness.1
An Oxford study released last week, showed a similar — but not as severe — decline in efficacy over time, although that likely has to do with the shorter time frame of this study. The Pfizer vaccine was shown to be 92% effective in preventing infection in those with a high viral load two weeks after the second dose, but had declined to 78% by three months following the second dose.2 AstraZeneca's effectiveness fell from 69% in those with a high viral load two weeks after the second dose, to 61% by three months following the second dose.2
And so we should not be surprised by the rise in COVID-19 cases in countries such as Israel and the United States, given that they were able to fully vaccinate earlier than other countries (especially Israel). It was reported last week that, for the first time since February, the United States reported more than 900,000 COVID-19 cases in the past week.3 This has driven home the aggressiveness of the Delta variant as well as the declining effectiveness of some vaccines. A look at statistics in one county of the United States — Los Angeles County — offers insight into this:

In March 2021, breakthrough infections among fully-vaccinated county residents comprised just 2% of that month’s total infections.4 
However, by June, when the Delta variant accounted for 50% of COVID infections in the county, breakthrough infections among fully-vaccinated residents accounted for 20% of all infections that month.4
And by late July, when the Delta variant comprised more than 90% of all infections, breakthrough cases represented 30% of total infections.4 

COVID data rattles US consumers 

The resurgence of COVID-19 has cast a pall over consumer sentiment in the United States. The preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading for August clocked in at 70.2, a big tumble from the July final reading of 81.2.5 The gravity of this reading was underscored by the Michigan Surveys chief economist, “Over the past half century, the Sentiment Index has only recorded larger losses in six other surveys, all connected to sudden negative changes in the economy: the only larger declines in the Sentiment Index occurred during the economy's shutdown in April 2020 (-19.4%) and at the depths of the Great Recession in October 2008 (-18.1%).”5 
My takeaway from this reading is that headlines — especially around a scary, contagious disease that we still know so little about — can have a big impact on sentiment in a short period of time. This is illustrated by a recent poll by Morning Consult, which shows that 31% of Americans view COVID-19 as a severe health risk, up from 21% just a month ago.6 
Mobility data remains solid
However, I am not going to let the consumer sentiment reading spook me. I think it is much more informative to look at mobility data. While more people say they are scared of COVID-19 and they feel worse about the economy, that hasn’t stopped them from actually getting out and going to restaurants and shops— at least not yet. 
Google’s mobility data for the US (which looks at a simple average of retail and recreation, workplace, transit stations, and grocery and pharmacy stores) is showing only a slight slowdown as of Aug.19. It seems as though the only place most Americans still don’t want to go is back to the office. Of course, we will want to follow mobility data closely to see if there is a negative impact from COVID-19 fallout in coming weeks.  
Investor sentiment has fallen — but for how long?
Not only did recent COVID-19 data cast a pall over consumer sentiment, it cast a pall over investor sentiment as well. In the past week, the 10-year Treasury yield fell, major US stock indices fell, and oil prices were down while the VIX was up significantly. And the reality is that the COVID resurgence could cause a modest slowdown in some parts of the world, as it has in China (although that is the result of multiple factors, some unrelated to COVID). It could do so soon in the UK, the eurozone, Canada and other countries as vaccine effectiveness wears off. However, I continue to believe that it will just produce slight hiccups in the US and other countries that are willing and able to quickly roll out booster shots. In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday announced its full approval of the Pfizer vaccine, which could be a big help in encouraging more people to get vaccinated.
I should stress that it is not just COVID that is having an impact on markets; it is the narrative being adopted by many market participants that the Federal Reserve will begin tightening as economic growth is slowing due to COVID, hitting the US economy with a “double whammy.” Admittedly, that narrative was helped along by the release of the minutes for July’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which showed that the Fed is moving swiftly toward tapering in the near future. 

But we have to keep in mind that what happened at the July meeting was based on stale information — the COVID situation has changed a lot since then. Fortunately, Fed “hawk” and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan calmed market fears on Friday. He acknowledged that while so far the COVID resurgence has “not had a material effect on — based on high-frequency data — dining out, consumer activity,” it is having an impact in terms of delaying office return plans and the ability to hire workers given growing fears of infection.7 He recognized that COVID is the “big imponderable” and pledged he would closely follow the impact it has on the US economy. He suggested that, if it does have a material impact on the US economy, he would advocate for an adjustment to tapering plans. This is significant because Kaplan was the first to call for the Fed to begin tapering.

All eyes on Powell’s Jackson Hole speech

And so now Fed Chair Jay Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole (scheduled for Aug. 27) takes on even more significance. There are some who expect his speech to be about cryptocurrencies, given references to crypto in the most recent FOMC minutes, and the Fed’s development of a central bank digital currency, which is a related topic and one where there is ongoing research momentum at the Fed. However, I hold out hope that he will talk about tapering. More specifically, I expect him to reiterate that tapering is likely to happen soon and discuss details. 
Of course, I would really like to see Powell amplify what Kaplan said last week — that the Fed will be willing to adjust tapering plans depending upon COVID’s impact on the economy. I can’t promise his speech will be as fun to watch as the newest episode of “Ted Lasso,” but it’s definitely going to be must-see TV at my house — popcorn and all.

Key takeaways
Innovative cancer care
Companies around the world are researching ways to fight cancer using different types of cells that make up the immune system.
Looking for early opportunities
We steer clear of larger drug companies, insurers, and hospitals because we believe there is little potential for transformational growth in these areas.
A global approach
We focus on smaller firms that are designing new and innovative ways to address unmet medical needs — and as global investors, we’re not geographically limited in our search.

From dime-sized pacemakers to orthopedic robots, health care has been advancing at an incredible pace, and we believe it will continue to transform over the next several decades. One area where we see great promise is cancer care. We envision a future where breakthrough immunotherapies produced by small, innovative companies around the world can treat this disease more effectively and without the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy, while also lowering the cost of treatment.
The downside of chemotherapy
Cancer has been part of the human condition since antiquity. It was written about in ancient Greek times, and tumors have been found in Egyptian mummies. Today, we know that cancer occurs when mutated cells in our body find a way to evade the immune system’s surveillance and grow unchecked.
Using chemotherapy to treat cancer was a major breakthrough. It has cured and extended the life of countless people. However, chemotherapy introduces a poisonous substance into the body, with the hope that it will kill the fast-growing tumor before too many healthy cells succumb to the poison. Chemo also has a negative impact on the body’s immune system, which is something doctors are desperately trying to avoid in the age of COVID-19, and could have an accelerating impact on new, innovative alternatives.
Companies around the world are researching ways to fight cancer using different types of cells that make up the immune system — from antibodies, which were known about in the 1890s, to antigen-specific natural killer cells that were discovered as recently as 2006; as well as T cells, B cells, and other types of natural killer cells.  
Using antibodies to fight cancer
Antibodies have been used since the 1980s to treat human diseases. More recently, our improved understanding of them has enabled doctors to treat cancers of the immune system with antibodies. 
We own stocks of two companies — Denmark’s Genmab and Germany’s MorphoSys — that are using antibodies to target blood cancers.1 In addition, one of MorphoSys’s antibody treatments is in trials for the treatment of lymphoma, which is a cancer of the lymph nodes.
Tailoring IL-2 to reduce side effects
One of the “SOS” pheromones released by the body — Interleukin (IL)-2 — was approved as an anti-cancer drug in 1992. While it was great at getting rid of the tumor, a very high dose was needed, which caused the immune system to overreact and produce toxic side effects that were unacceptable to patients and doctors.
US-based Nektar Therapeutics, one of our largest and longest-held positions, has used its specialty PEGylation process to change the structure of the IL-2 molecule.1 Nektar’s process makes IL-2 more efficient at recruiting killer T cells and memory T cells — which fight the tumor — and less efficient at recruiting regulatory T cells — which scientists now know can reduce the effectiveness of the killer T cells. This allows for smaller doses of a drug to be administered, thereby rending the therapy safe enough for widespread use. 
Nektar’s IL-2 formulation is known as Bempeg, and it is currently in phase III trials in combination with an approved immune-oncology drug from Bristol Myers (not a fund holding) called Opdivo. Opdivo is an example of a new class of immunotherapy drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors. These drugs shut down the false “all is well” signals that cancer cells use to evade the body’s immune system near a tumor. Pairing Bempeg with Opdivo, and potentially other checkpoint inhibitors, should be complementary, allowing the immune system to get near the tumor and recruit more T cells to deal with it. 
Developing new immunotherapy drugs
Excitement around immunotherapy picked up in 2010, with the approval of drugs from Bristol Myers and Merck (not a fund holding). Over the past decade, researchers have continued to make breakthroughs in this area. For example, Nektar has more immuno-oncology drugs in its pipeline, and these drugs have novel mechanisms of action: 

Nektar’s NKTR-262 uses a class of proteins known as toll-like receptors (TLRs) to signal for help. NKTR-262 is injected into the tumor, causing damage and displacing fragments of the tumor. The drug stimulates the production of TLRs, and the TLRs aid in the process of making antigen-specific killer T cells. Here, antigens are the fragments of the tumor, and the antigen-presenting cells teach the T cells what they should target in the fight, i.e., anything that looks like the tumor fragment. NKTR-262 is being tested in combination with Bempeg, which stimulates killer T cells and memory T cells.
NKTR-255 is a PEGylated version of IL-15. IL-15 was discovered in 1994 and is in the same family of signals as IL-2. It stimulates the growth of memory and killer T cells as well as natural killer cells, and naturally doesn’t affect the more dangerous regulatory T cells. There are a number of trials ongoing with NKTR-255 both alone and in combination with some of the antibody drugs mentioned above. Nektar’s PEGylated version of IL-15 is designed to last longer in the body, thereby facilitating smaller and less frequent dosing for the patient.

Getting in early
We invest in companies that we believe have years of transformational growth ahead of them — and as global investors, we’re not geographically limited in our search. 
We’re especially interested in companies that are at the forefront of the fight against cancer — one of the largest areas of investment in our portfolio is in the health care sector. However, we steer clear of larger drug companies, insurers, and hospitals because we believe there is little potential for transformational growth in these areas. Instead, we focus on smaller firms that are designing new and innovative ways to address unmet medical needs. Through our early investments in these companies, our investors can potentially benefit from these companies’ innovations and their potential to transform health care.

Alternatives: An outcome-based approach that aligns alternative portfolios with investor objectives 
As investors seek to enhance growth, diversification, and income, alternative assets have become an increasingly important part of institutional portfolios. Alternatives are powerful investment tools, but their behavior and effect on portfolios is often misunderstood.
A factor-based approach to asset allocation can help. By providing greater clarity around forecasted risks, returns, and correlations between portfolio assets, a factor-based analysis lets us develop a more efficient portfolio allocation that includes alternatives to improve the portfolio’s ability to meet investment objectives.
In this paper, we discuss:

A basic definition of alternatives
A factor-based approach to alternatives
Applications of alternatives for income, growth, real return, and customization

Learn why incorporating a factor-based approach to alternatives can help investors reach their objectives.

Key takeaways
Stocks face a wall of worry
Stocks had had a disappointing week last week, and there’s a lot of concern among investors.
What could help stocks climb it?
Sometimes the catalyst for stocks to move higher can simply be a pullback that is perceived to be a buying opportunity. That could be in the offing.

For the most part, global stocks have had a disappointing run in recent days. There are a number of concerning factors at the moment, and stocks haven’t been climbing the proverbial “wall of worry.” At least not yet. In this week’s commentary, I explain what’s driving investors’ worries, and what catalyst could possibly help boost stocks over the wall. 
What’s driving the ‘wall of worry’? 
The concerns include:
The Federal Reserve’s taper talk. The hope that the August jobs report might delay the start of tapering was dashed last week by “Fedspeak.” We heard from several Fed officials who shared the general view that tapering should be announced and should commence soon. St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard said it best, arguing that he is not concerned about the August jobs report because there isn’t a scarcity of jobs: “There is plenty of demand for workers and there are more job openings than there are unemployed workers.”1 In other words, this is not a typical weak jobs market — it is unique to the pandemic. Jobs are actually robust — people just aren’t taking them. Bullard advocated for tapering to start this year and finish in the first half of 2022. This “Fedspeak” certainly didn’t lift markets.
Europe’s “temporary tapering.” The European Central Bank (ECB) announced it is not tapering — but it will be “adjusting” asset purchases downward for the next few months. In other words, the recalibration will result in a decrease in asset purchases, although it is expected to be brief. While ECB President Christine Lagarde has forbidden use of the word “tapering,” some investors are skeptical — they view it as temporary tapering that could become more permanent, and that added to negative sentiment last week. 
Fear about earnings. There is a view that “the best is in the rearview mirror” for corporate earnings, and that they won’t be as good going forward. Yes, I expect earnings growth to moderate — it has to, as it has been extremely high. But earnings growth estimates for the coming quarters remain strong, with analysts projecting earnings growth of more than 20% for the fourth quarter of 2021.2 Yes, it should slow from there, with FactSet estimates at 9.4% for calendar year 2022, but that is nothing to sneeze at. 
Concerns about COVID-19. COVID-19 infections continue to command headlines. As I have said, this hasn’t had a big impact on mobility, but it certainly has weighed on investors’ minds. And there is always the specter of a much worse variant emerging, although thus far the Mu variant does not appear to be as formidable as some have feared.
Inflation concerns. The August US Producer Price Index (PPI) was a bit unnerving, surging 0.7% (and 0.6% ex-food and energy).2 Year-over-year, the PPI was up 8.3% overall and 6.7% on core.3 And inflationary pressures aren’t unique to the US. There is enough concern about inflation that a number of emerging markets central banks have been hiking rates. However, this print doesn’t change my view that the big increase in inflation is largely temporary, but it did give investors pause, adding fuel to fears about a “stagflationary” environment. 
Threats to the “political status quo.” Markets like political stability, and there is some uncertainty right now, starting with the upcoming Canadian elections, which threaten to unseat Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. We also have the surprise resignation of Japan’s prime minister, Suga Yoshihide, and uncertainty about who will replace him. And there are concerns about the direction Germany is moving in — and, therefore, the European Union as well — given recent polling on the national election that will occur later this month (Chancellor Angela Merkel’s successor is not polling well).
Seasonal jitters. Finally, there is fear simply because we are in September, heading to October, given a few epic market drops that have occurred this time of year. But as my colleague Brian Levitt recently explained, a few rough Septembers have played an oversized role in spoiling the month’s reputation, and more recent Septembers haven’t followed the negative storyline. This is also true for October.
How can stocks climb the wall?
It’s clear that there’s a wall of assorted worries, and investors haven’t climbed it yet. But that’s OK. Last week, in a media interview, I was asked what catalyst was likely to move stocks higher. One very possible catalyst is a market pullback. In this environment, with an improving global economy, adequate fiscal stimulus, and very accommodative monetary policy, I expect the gravitational pull of stocks to be higher. Sometimes the catalyst for stocks to move higher can simply be a pullback that is perceived to be a buying opportunity. That could be in the offing; I for one would welcome it.
In the meantime, I will be watching a number of issues, including the following.
Six issues for investors to watch
The Fed. The next Fed meeting occurs next week, and there is growing consensus that the start of tapering will be announced after that meeting. But I must repeat that I don’t think investors should be concerned. This has been well-telegraphed in advance, and despite some hiccups, US economic growth remains solid. So in my view, this Fed action is appropriate and shouldn’t derail markets. 

September and October US jobs reports. I can’t disagree with Bullard — this is not a weak jobs market. And as I have said before, I expect people to start taking those jobs now that kids are back in school and enhanced unemployment benefits have ended. The September and October US jobs reports will be litmus tests for my thesis, but I don’t think the Fed will wait that long to announce the start of tapering — and, again, that will be OK for markets, despite jitters right now.
US corporate tax increase. Congressional Democrats are proposing a corporate tax hike to 26.5%. If that’s the case, I think that would be a best possible scenario under the circumstances — we all knew there had to be a corporate tax increase in the offing, and it could have been much worse. Now there are other taxes they are proposing as well – and there is certainly dissension on these proposals. We will want to follow this closely.
US debt ceiling. We also have this looming issue of the debt ceiling. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a letter to congressional leaders last week that the Treasury Department may not be able to keep paying the government’s obligations by next month unless Congress raises or suspends the federal borrowing limit. This couldn’t come at a worse time given the severe divisions in Congress right now. I do expect it to be resolved, but I suspect it will come down to the wire and give us all a few upset stomachs and gray hairs in the process.
Economic growth forecasts. There has been so much focus on recent economic growth downgrades, but there have been some upward revisions as well. The ECB upgraded its growth forecast for this year to 5% from 4.6% in its June forecast.4 While the ECB raised inflation expectations, they still show a substantial drop from 2021 to 2022, supporting the view that inflation is largely temporary. Inflation is now projected to be 2.2% this year but is forecast to fall to 1.7% next year — materially below the ECB’s 2% target.4 I of course will be following mobility and economic data closely, but I also will be tracking forecasts.
US-China trade relations. There was some optimism around the conversation last week between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, but I don’t think that will change much. I expect relations to remain strained for the time being, but I will be following closely in hopes that US tariffs will be rolled back, which would be a real positive for all concerned.
Of note
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the 20th anniversary of 9/11, which occurred this past weekend. Many of my US colleagues worked in the World Trade Center and were directly impacted by the attacks. I cannot think of this day without a heavy heart, and I will continue to pray for all the victims of this horrible act of terrorism, including their families, friends, and all loved ones.

Global Market Strategist
Key takeaways
The clock is ticking
If the debt ceiling isn’t raised, the federal government could soon lose its ability to borrow money to pay its bills.
Taxes can’t cover all expenses
The government would still be able to spend the tax money it receives, but the Treasury would have to prioritize which bills get paid and which do not.
A contentious debate lies ahead
While I expect the government to raise the debt ceiling, we could see some unsettling headlines and market gyrations along the way.

It’s time again for America’s least favorite pastime — the debate over whether to raise the debt ceiling.  Recent comments by Senator Mitch McConnell that Republicans will not vote for a debt ceiling increase without major structural spending reforms have driven concern from market participants.  Unlike 2011 (or other past debt ceiling standoffs), the Democrats don’t need Republican votes to raise the debt ceiling. However, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi has warned that the Democrats will not go it alone and raise the debt ceiling through the reconciliation process.  The political game of chicken is upon us. 
So what comes next, and what could it all mean for stocks? It’s possible that markets could have a few unsettled days in the coming weeks as investors price in the prospect of the government not being able to meet its obligations, meaning a potential large fiscal drag at a very inopportune time. But it’s important to remember that in the last two standoffs over the debt ceiling, 2011 and 2013, US equities declined in the month leading up to the “feared date” only to post substantial returns in the following 12 months after the drama subsided.1
In the following commentary, we answer the most frequently asked questions about the debt ceiling and conclude with an optimistic view that the latest standoff will pass without meaningful incident.
What is the debt ceiling?
Every day the federal government spends more money than it brings in and makes up the difference with borrowed money — but there’s a limit to how much debt it can take on. In 1917, the Second Liberty Bond Act placed an $8 billion limit on the amount of government bonds that can be issued.  Congress has voted to increase the limit many times since 1917, including 18 times during the Reagan administration, eight times during the Clinton administration, and seven times during George W. Bush’s administration, when the practice was treated as a mere formality by Congress.  Congress even raised the debt ceiling five times during the Obama administration, when the process was more contentious.  The Trump administration raised the debt ceiling multiple times before suspending it in 2019.2
Why has the debt ceiling debate reemerged?
The debt limit in 2019, at the time it was suspended, stood at $22 trillion.3 It was recently reinstated at approximately $28.5 trillion.  The current federal government debt outstanding is $28.427316 trillion.4 The Treasury Department’s legal authority to issue additional debt that increases the amount outstanding expired on Aug. 1, 2021.  
What is currently being done about it?
According to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the government has so far managed to pay its bills through extraordinary measures and accounting maneuvers.  Extraordinary measures have included suspending investments in certain government pension funds, suspending state and local government series securities, and borrowing money set aside to manage exchange rate fluctuations.
When will the extraordinary measures be exhausted? 
The Treasury Department has not provided a specific estimate for how long the extraordinary measures will last, but Yellen estimated that cash and extraordinary measures could be exhausted in October.  
What happens then?
After that date, the US Treasury will no longer be able to issue new debt to fund expenses.  As Yellen stated, “Once all available measures and cash on hand are fully exhausted, the United States of America would be unable to meet its obligations for the first time in our history.”    
So does that mean the US would default on its debt?
No. The government would still be able to spend the tax money it receives from all of us, which is expected to total over $315 billion per month in 2021 and 2022, according to the White House Office of Budget and Management.  The Treasury would have to prioritize how to spend that money, but it would be enough to cover Social Security and Medicare payments, debt service, and payments to the military.  
But without being able to borrow from the market, the government would be strapped.  Everything from federal salaries to IRS refunds to payments to the Department of Education could be cut off.  The federal government employs 2.2 million people; a stoppage of paychecks to almost 1.5% of the total labor force would slow the US economy.5
Will the US raise the debt ceiling?
Ultimately, we expect the debt ceiling to be raised.  Make no mistake, the debate will be very combative, and we will likely once again approach the 11th hour with the outcome unknown.  It’s possible that we will follow a similar pattern as with the debt ceiling debates of 2011 and 2013, when the nation’s policymakers cobbled together a necessary, albeit suboptimal, deal that saves face for both sides.  It’s also still possible that the Congressional Democrats, despite their recent pledge to not do so, will raise the debt ceiling through the reconciliation process.  
What could this mean for stocks?
In the last two standoffs over the debt ceiling, 2011 and 2013, US equities declined in the month leading up to the “feared date” only to post substantial returns in the following 12 months.6 US Treasury rates have been below 3% since 2011 and declined following the 2013 debt ceiling standoff as sharp spending cuts known as sequestration slowed the US economy.7

Key takeaways
The pandemic shutdowns and spiking demand from the sharp economic recovery has strained even the most sophisticated, resilient supply chain
But for semiconductors, there is a flourishing underlying trend that is driving the shortages and pushing investments all through the industry.
We can see by the array of products that are being delayed due to semiconductor shortages just how widespread their use has become
Our fund is invested in a number of companies across the semiconductor supply chain that we believe could help meet the demand for chips.

Supply chains have rarely been in the public consciousness as much as they are presently. In particular, the shortages afflicting the global semiconductor supply chain have been common fodder for headlines this year. The pandemic shutdowns and spiking demand from the sharp economic recovery has strained even the most sophisticated, resilient supply chain. But for semiconductors, there is a flourishing underlying trend that is driving the shortages and pushing investments all through the industry.
We can see by the array of products that are being delayed due to semiconductor shortages just how widespread their use has become — from cars to robotic vacuum cleaners to dog-washing booths. Even something as simple as a light bulb can have semiconductor content built into it. For example, connected light bulbs, controllable from a smartphone app, have become increasingly common in new homes. 

This dynamic is part of what we mean when we talk about our “Big Compute” investment theme. In the Invesco Global Opportunities Fund, we’re invested in a number of different companies across the semiconductor supply chain that we believe have the technological leadership to help meet the demand for chips across this broad spectrum of sophistication and use cases. 

PVA TePla is a German company that makes the furnaces to grow silicon ingots. These ingots are then sliced to make the wafers of silicon that are the foundation of just about every computer chip out there. They recently received an order from a top-five silicon wafer manufacturer that is significantly expanding its manufacturing capacity in Singapore.

Meanwhile, Applied Materials is an American company that makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which takes those silicon wafers and adds the transistors that do the computing. Its CEO has spoken about strong demand continuing for many years. He is forecasting half a trillion connected devices and reiterates that semiconductors have strategic importance for national security reasons.1 

This increase in demand is being driven not just by a wider array of end industries, but also by the much greater need for computational power that businesses and consumers demand. As computing has moved from mainframes to PCs, and now to servers and data centers, each successive step has required more and faster processors. The internet has been one of the most important innovations in human history, enabling us to share information nearly instantaneously across the world. The websites on which we rely are hosted across a vast array of servers and data centers; they are everywhere their customers need them to be. Cloud computing and the delivery of software through the internet is an important trend, as is the delivery of movies and videogames.

What are clouds made of? The answer: Chips.

The “cloud” can be a bit of a nebulous concept for people to grasp, but it’s important to remember that in order for the cloud to exist, it needs physical hardware as well. The racks of servers in data centers around the world that support cloud computing are vital bits of infrastructure that ensure all of the technology used in our daily lives runs smoothly. 

Consumers are insatiable in their demand for more data, faster. It’s now expected that whatever website you visit will pop up instantaneously, and whatever criteria you punch into a search engine will deliver results faster than you can blink. To get to this point, and to reduce lag time even further, data needs to be housed in more servers, connections to that data need to be faster, and information needs to be more accessible. To do all of this, you need more and better chips to do all of the computing, render the graphics, and facilitate the lightning-fast information transfer we all expect to see. 

This dynamic is another key part of our “Big Compute” theme, and we think Advanced Micro Devices (also known as AMD) could be a major beneficiary. AMD is one of our largest and longest-held positions in the fund. We’ve owned AMD since the early 2000s, and have seen its transition from a struggling also-ran to its current position as perhaps the most innovative designer of CPUs in the world. This company operates in several important areas related to the Big Compute theme, from providing the advanced chips that power cloud computing data centers, to the graphical processors necessary for the most immersive video game experiences, and more recently into the area of 5G smartphone service through the acquisition of Xilinx, formerly a competitor. AMD’s advanced chips are also used for things like cryptocurrency mining and artificial intelligence research. No matter how the future of computing plays out, we’re confident that AMD will remain an integral part of this important structural growth theme.

Speaking of 5G, we don’t think there’s any company better positioned to potentially benefit from the rollout of this next generation of wireless service than Qualcomm. This San Diego-based company was a pioneer in the 2G generation of cell phone technology back in the 1990s; its patented code-division multiple access (CDMA) technology became the standard adopted by the entire industry, and the company’s stock was one of the best-performing of that decade. Over the years, Qualcomm has continued to innovate and now has a significant intellectual property portfolio related to 5G standards. They put out a prototype 5G modem chip in 2017, which was able to create the first-ever working 5G data connection, demonstrating mobile internet speed of 1 Gbps. The first smartphones with Qualcomm’s 5G technology incorporated into them were sold in 2019, and they have partnership deals with nearly every major mobile device manufacturer to license their technology. As the structural trend toward the faster mobile data speeds provided by 5G technology continues, we think Qualcomm could be a major beneficiary.

 “Can you hear me now?” asks the light bulb

Nordic Semiconductor is a Norwegian company that specializes in Bluetooth connectivity through ultra-low-power chips, which are going to be needed for the half a trillion connected devices — nobody wants to have to change all those batteries! Even connected to the electric grid, when one has 50 connected devices in their home, they need to be low power users. Nordic Semiconductor allows for these connected devices to send and receive information over cellular networks or using Bluetooth, and they ship more than one million Bluetooth LE (Low Energy) chips every day.  

The bottom line

We invest in companies that we think have years of transformational growth ahead of them. To achieve the growth potential we look for, it helps to have the tailwind of a powerful demographic or technological trend behind you. In the case of companies that operate within our Big Compute theme, we believe they should be well-positioned to help our clients achieve their investment objectives in the years and decades to come.

Key takeaways
August brought the second down month for midstream equities since September 2020
Oil and gas drilling activity has continued its strong recovery from 2020’s lows, and midstream EBITDA is almost back to pre-COVID levels.
Second-quarter earnings season suggests midstream earnings are almost back to normal
Operating performance has been, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA coming in 2.2% higher than consensus estimates.
Industry activity continues to churn higher after the slowdown associated with COVID and the OPEC/Russia market share battle
Since the lows of 2020, activity has steadily recovered, with the latest data showing 507 rigs and 240 completion crews operating.

August brought just the second down month for midstream equities since September 2020. Oil and gas drilling activity has continued its strong recovery from the COVID lows of 2020, and midstream Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is almost back to pre-COVID levels. The number of rigs operating in the United States has doubled from the low hit in August 2020, while the number of crews placing new wells into production is up 433% from the lows hit in May 2020.
MLP market overview

Midstream MLPs, as measured by the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), ended August down 3.4% on a price basis and down 2.3% after distributions are considered. The AMZ underperformed the S&P 500 Index’s 3.0% total return for the month. The best-performing midstream subsector for August was the Marine group, while the Compression subsector underperformed, on average.

For the year through August, the AMZ is up 27.0% on a price basis, resulting in a 35.1% total return. This compares to the S&P 500 Index’s 20.4% and 21.6% price and total returns, respectively. The Gathering and Processing group has produced the best average total return year-to-date, while the Compression subsector has lagged.

MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-Year US Treasury Bond, widened by 17 basis points (bps) over the month, exiting the period at 674 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 694 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 429 bps. The AMZ distribution yield at month-end was 8.1%.

Midstream MLPs and affiliates raised no new marketed equity (common or preferred, excluding at-the-market programs) and issued $0.8 billion of new debt during the month. No significant net new asset acquisitions were announced over the month, with one deal among current publicly traded sector participants.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil exited the month at $68.50 per barrel, down 7.4% over the period and 60.8% higher year-over-year. Natural gas prices ended August at $4.38 per million British thermal units (MMbtu), up 11.8% over the month and 66.4% higher than August 2020. Natural gas liquids (NGL) priced at Mont Belvieu exited the month at $40.02 per barrel, 1.1% higher than the end of July and 99.8% higher than the year-ago period.

News

Second-quarter earnings season wrapped up and suggests midstream earnings are almost back to normal. Second-quarter reporting season wound down in August. Through month-end, 47 midstream entities had announced distributions for the quarter, including eight distribution increases, two reductions, and 37 distributions that were unchanged from the previous quarter. Through the end of August, 51 sector participants had reported second-quarter financial results. Operating performance has been, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA coming in 2.2% higher than consensus estimates but 11.0% lower than the preceding quarter that included certain benefits from the price dislocations associated with Winter Storm Uri. Total second-quarter industry EBITDA of approximately $16.6 billion is down just 2% from the pre-COVID levels (first quarter of 2020). For reference, the unprecedented impact of COVID containment efforts on transportation fuel consumption as well as production shut-ins in reaction to the collapse of crude oil pricing during the second quarter of 2020 (at one point, the front month crude oil contract settled at a history setting negative $37 per barrel), caused second-quarter 2020 sector EBITDA to dip to $15.1 billion, which was down 11% from the first quarter of 2020.
BPMP received roll-up offer. BP Midstream Partners (NYSE: BPMP) received a non-binding offer to be acquired by an entity controlled by its sponsor BP, PLC (NYSE: BP) via an exchange of all outstanding common units of BPMP for newly issued American Depositary Receipts of BP p.l.c. at a value of $13.01 per BPMP common unit.
SUN buys terminals from NS and Cato. Sunoco LP (NYSE: SUN) announced the execution of definitive agreements to acquire eight refined product terminals from NuStar Energy LP (NYSE: NS) and one refined product terminal from Cato, Inc. for a combined purchase price of $255.5 million. These acquisitions are expected to result in a significant expansion of SUN's midstream business, enhance its platform for fuel distribution expansion. and allow SUN to remain within its long-term leverage and coverage target levels. Additionally, the sale allows NS to further improve its debt metrics.

Chart of the month: Checking in on industry activity

Industry activity continued to churn higher after the slowdown associated with the OPEC/Russia market share battle and subsequent global slowdown due to the impact of COVID-19 mitigation. According to data from Primary Vision, entering 2020 there were approximately 800 drilling rigs and 320 completion crews operating in the United States. The rig count hit a low of 244 in August 2020, down 70% from the start of the year, while completion crews troughed in May at 45, down 86%. Since these lows, activity has steadily recovered (completion activity paused briefly during Winter Storm Uri), with the latest data showing 507 rigs and 240 completion crews operating.

Key takeaways
Continuing recovery presents opportunities for investors
Driven by increasing vaccination rates and growing consumer spending, the economy continues to recover, providing opportunities for investors.
Value stocks look attractive
Companies whose stocks are at attractive prices (aka “value stocks”) have historically performed well as the economy grows
Commodities can help hedge against rising inflation
Investors can help protect themselves against the risks of rising inflation by considering commodities, an asset class that can potentially help investors hedge their portfolios against rising inflation.

A year ago, the economy was at a standstill. Fast forward to today, and the situation is continuing to improve. Driven by rising vaccination rates, state and local governments continue to explore easing restrictions, and consumer spending may continue to rise.
For investors, this presents an opportunity, alongside a key consideration: How do you position a portfolio to take advantage of the continuing economic recovery, while also protecting against the inflation that may result from it?
For stocks, consider “value” companies
Investments and spending by companies is surging 1, and consumer spending is set to accelerate when government lockdown restrictions ease. As a result of this activity, certain companies stand to benefit from potential growth in their earnings (e.g. more investment and consumer spending results in higher earnings). In particular, companies whose stock are deemed “value stocks” may perform well, which investors may want to consider allocating to in their portfolio. When considering value stocks, it’s important to understand what they are and why they have performed well during economic expansion. In the chart below, you can see that the S&P 500 Pure Value Index has outperformed both the S&P 500 Value Index and the S&P 500 Index. Why? Because, not all value is created equally, and the S&P 500 Pure Value strategy gives you almost 2x the amount of value exposure versus the traditional value Index.

Considering an ETF trade? Here are some best practices for investors looking to execute trades during times of market volatility:
1) Use limit orders
Limit orders offer advantages over market orders, as these provide certainty on the trade price by preventing purchase (with a buy limit order) or sale (with a sell limit order) unless the price meets your requirements. A market order may be effective when placing small trades in highly liquid ETFs, but there is a risk that it could be executed at an undesirable price. A limit order, however, sets the price at which you are willing to transact. The closer your price is to the bid or ask, the greater the probability that your sell or buy will be executed. The use of a limit order is not without risk, as your trade may not be executable at the specified price.
2) Don’t trade near the market open
In general, it may be prudent to avoid trading within the first and last 15 minutes of the trading day. Not all of an ETF’s underlying securities may have started trading within the first few minutes of the session, in which case the market maker1 cannot accurately price the ETF. 
3) Watch for volatility
Increased market volatility in underlying securities prices may result in the widening of an ETF’s bid-ask spreads, causing the ETF to trade at a larger premium or discount. In these fast-paced environments, seeking trading assistance maybe be prudent and investors are should consider using limit orders. 
4) Consider spreads, not volume
An ETF with substantial trading volume may appear to offer superior liquidity, but it’s not always the best measure. An ETF’s historical and current bid-ask spread may be a better indicator of liquidity because it includes the liquidity of its underlying securities.
5) Use bid and asks to determine current market price
Using the price of the last trade can be problematic, as the data may be stale and not representative of the current market environment. The current bid and ask prices better reflect the fair value of any security. In particular, the bid and ask prices offered by market makers are representative of the weighted average of the basket of securities in the ETF itself. Be aware that the market maker (see “who is a market maker” below) bid-ask may not be the top of book bid-ask. The market maker bid-ask spread serves as goal posts to manage the price of the ETF. Other buyers and sellers in the market are usually within this range.
6) Watch the clock for international ETFs
If possible, it may be preferable to trade international ETFs during the trading hours of the underlying securities. Prices of international ETFs traded in the US tend to be closer to the value of the underlying securities (with a narrower bid-ask spread) when their respective markets are open and overlap with domestic trading hours. Note that Asia-Pacific markets are always closed during North American trading hours. Most European markets close between 11:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The closing bell does not stem the flow of information that can affect the value of foreign-listed securities. A price of an NYSE-listed international ETF whose local market is closed may reflect new information with the potential to change the premium or discount relative to the ETF’s stated NAV, which reflects the last quoted prices of the underlying securities.

Key takeaways
How have markets reacted?
Early last week, global markets sold off due to fears that Evergrande may be another Lehman Brothers, but we think markets misinterpreted the Evergrande situation.
What is our outlook?
We think that Chinese policymakers are likely to provide more clarity and enact more forceful measures in the coming days and weeks to stave off systemic risks.
What are the economic growth implications?
We expect all of this to translate into slower but more stable growth in China, but at the cost of less uplift to growth in certain other areas of the world.

The China Evergrande situation captured the world’s attention in a big way last week. In this blog, I take a step back and summarize what has happened so far, what the next steps may be, and how this impacts our view of the markets.
What has happened?
For more than a year, Chinese policymakers have been focused on reducing financial and economic risks through reform. Concerned about rising real estate prices and rising debt levels in China’s real estate sector, policymakers introduced a deleveraging campaign in August 2020 to improve the financial health and stability of the real estate sector. The campaign is focused on “three red lines” — caps on debt that must be met by mid-2023 by real estate developers1:

Liability to asset ratio (excluding advance receipts) cap of 70%
Net debt to equity ceiling of 100%
Cash to short-term debt ratio of no lower than 1

Chinese property firms were given a three-year transition period to meet those debt requirements through deleveraging. If they did not meet one or two of the “red line” requirements, significant limits would be placed on the extent to which they could grow debt. However, if they could not meet all three of the requirements, they would not be allowed to grow their debt at all.
Since then, most real estate developers have lowered their debt levels. Evergrande embarked on a number of measures to lower its debt but has faced difficulty, with some assets being sold at fire sale prices. As recently as April, Bloomberg reported that Evergrande had fallen behind other property companies in making progress towards those three red line requirements and had not met any of them.2
In June, Evergrande revealed that it missed servicing some commercial paper on time. On Aug. 24, Evergrande issued a public statement warning about its difficulties in servicing debt and asking for assistance from the Chinese government. The firm also said construction at some of its developments had halted due to missed payments to contractors and suppliers. Last week, Evergrande was able to make interest payments on its debt to domestic bondholders but not its debt to foreign bondholders.
In addition, bond ratings agency Fitch downgraded its economic growth forecast for China last week, largely due to its concerns about the “slowdown in the property sector.”
Why is this important to investors?
Evergrande is one of the largest real estate developers in China, but it is also a conglomerate that makes electric vehicles and owns amusement parks and a soccer team. It is a major property owner, a major employer and has a high level of liabilities.  
In November 2018, the People’s Bank of China reported that Evergrande was one of the few financial holding conglomerates that could cause systemic risk to China. If Evergrande were to go bankrupt, there would be serious negative ramifications for all businesses it owes money to, as well as its debt holders, its shareholders and its employees. Evergrande’s failure could also create some form of contagion that extends well beyond China.
How have markets reacted?
Early last week, global markets sold off as concerns grew that Evergrande would not be able to make its interest payments. There was even fear that Evergrande could be another Lehman Brothers, in that its failure could trigger contagion in global markets. This panic resulted in a major sell-off in Asian markets, which extended to markets across the globe.
We think markets misinterpreted the Evergrande situation in likening it to the failure of Lehman Brothers. With Lehman, US policymakers did not act to prevent a crisis, despite warnings about growing debt levels and risks to the real estate sector. Instead, policymakers were called on to remediate a crisis —- but then chose not to in the case of Lehman. In the current situation, Chinese policymakers were proactive in the face of rising debt levels and higher real estate prices, promulgating tighter regulations in the form of the three red lines. We believe China is well prepared and equipped to manage this problem, given that it likely assumed one or more real estate companies might encounter difficulties as a result of its debt caps.
Evergrande worries subsided as the week progressed — the company was able to make one of its interest payments and the People’s Bank of China intervened with a liquidity injection. Although most Asia Pacific indices were down for the week, the S&P 500 Index, the FTSE 100 and even the MSCI World Index finished the week higher.3 And other market signs suggest concerns have subsided, at least for now:

There has been very little movement in the China interbank lending rate.4
The US dollar rose last week and stands at the upper end of its recent trading range, but it is still well below where it stood when China devalued its currency in 2015 and where it was when the COVID-19 outbreak first emerged.5
US high yield credit spreads closed the week essentially where they started the week, with spreads very tight.6
US financial conditions tightened modestly but remain near the easiest on record.7

What is our take on what is happening?
We believe investors need to put this situation in perspective. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, we have dealt with issues similar to this before, and it is important to remind ourselves that these events proved to be blips in a longer upward march for equities.
A case in point is the eurozone debt crisis. It began on Jan. 10, 2010, with the European Union report on Greek accounting irregularities. In the three years following the start of the crisis, the S&P 500 Index rose 10.9%, the MSCI Europe Index rose 7.0%, and the MSCI World Index rose 7.7% on an annualized basis.8 For the five-year period following its start, the S&P 500 Index posted an annualized return of 15.4% the MSCI Europe Index had an annualized return of 8.8% and the MSCI World Index gained 10.0%.8
What is our outlook on the situation?
With regard to Evergrande, we believe the company is unlikely to be allowed to fail, but that it is likely to undergo a dramatic restructuring. Overall, we think that Chinese policymakers are likely to provide more clarity and enact more forceful measures in the coming days and weeks to stave off systemic risks. This should provide a backstop for Chinese markets and signal that authorities will not permit a property and financial system collapse. We could see more short-term liquidity injections, and we believe there could even be additional fiscal stimulus via an accelerated local bond issuance for infrastructure projects or a cut to the reserve requirement ratio in the coming weeks to stave off faltering economic growth and diminishing confidence in the country’s property market.
Additionally, we think that authorities may implement measures to protect retail customers of Evergrande’s pre-sold residential units and wealth management products to head off social disturbances. This could also bolster confidence in the real estate sector, an important part of China’s economy.
With regard to China, there have been concerns for many years about the rapid growth of debt, especially in the corporate sector. However, we think that China is better placed than most developed countries to either avoid or recover from debt crises. While it is true that Bank for International Settlements (BIS) data shows China’s non-financial sector debt-to-GDP ratio reached 289.5% in 2020 (up from 139% in 2008), this needs to be put into perspective.9 First, that same ratio for all countries covered by the BIS was 289.9%, so China is now in line with the global average. 9 Second, China’s debt ratio remains below that of countries such as the US (296.1%), the UK (304.4%), France (374.4%) and Japan (418.9%).9                                                                                                
It is also important to remember that China has a number of advantages when it comes to dealing with high debt ratios and debt crises:

Its economy is growing faster than developed world counterparts, which is helpful in controlling debt/GDP ratios.
Chinese government debt is only 67% of GDP, which suggests there is scope for the government to absorb some of the debt currently owed by the corporate sector.10
The central bank has more policy ammunition than many other large-country central banks (one-year policy rates are 4.35% and the reserve requirement ratio for major banks is 12%, both of which can be cut, thereby potentially easing financing conditions and boosting the supply of credit).11
China’s debt is a domestic affair, whereas a country such as the US is in large debt to the rest of the world. This makes it hard for the rest of the world to force a debt crisis upon China (though such a situation could occur for other reasons). China finds itself in this position because saving continually exceeds investment and it has built up large overseas assets (China’s net international investment position was +15% of GDP at the end of 2020, while for the US it was -67% of GDP).12
Hence, China owns a lot of overseas assets and it has used its foreign exchange (FX) reserves in the past to repair the banking sector and could do so again. (FX reserves stood at $3.2 trillion in August 2021, which amounts to about 8% of banking sector assets, though that is down from 25% in 2007).13

China’s banking sector has traditionally been conservatively funded, with liabilities around 90% funded by deposits (versus less than 80% in the US).14 However, that ratio has slipped in recent years to stand at 83% in mid-2021, whereas the US ratio has climbed in the last year to 88% (though the Chinese deposit/liability ratio is still above what was seen in the US for most of the last 20 years).15 Further, the non-performing loans ratio remains below 2% and the capital-to-asset ratio was 9.24% in 2020, which has only been bettered in 2019 (the US capital-to-asset ratio was 11.02% in 2020).16
Finally, there has been much concern expressed about the growth of shadow banking in China, the assumption being that it will bring instability. Financial Stability Board (FSB) data suggests that shadow banking assets in China have grown from 0.3% of GDP in 2006 to 56.3% of GDP in 2019 (shadow banking is defined by the FSB as non-bank financial entities involved in credit intermediation that may pose financial stability risks).17 That is certainly a big increase, but the ratio has stabilized since peaking at 65.7% in 2017.17 It leaves China in a similar position to South Korea (56.2%) and the UK (52.6%), while below Japan (62.6%) and the US (79.8%).17 It is also worth bearing in mind that shadow banking in the US peaked at an assets/GDP ratio of 129.9% in 2007. 17
Last week, International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Gita Gopinath explained, “China has the tools and the policy space to prevent this turning into a systemic crisis.”18 We would agree.
What is our resulting investment view?
Everything that we see here reinforces our view that investors should maintain a balanced, diversified portfolio rather than shifting out of regions or sectors that are directly exposed and where valuations have corrected significantly — such as China itself or China-facing supply chain economies, sectors or firms — and into already richly valued regions or sectors. Instead, we would consider a relative value approach to geographic, sector and firm-level exposures to the changing regulatory and business operating environment globally and in China itself.
What are the risks to our view?
There are three main focus areas that the market will be watching in the coming weeks and months:

The short-term specifics of the resolution of Evergrande’s balance sheet problems.
The medium-term implications for China’s real estate sector and its macroeconomy.
Last but not least, the longer-term implications for the rest of the world.

 
Short-term specifics of Evergrande’s balance sheet problems. We are monitoring the offshore dollar bonds, ongoing restructuring and policy signals. We believe many market participants are concerned about whether dollar bondholders will be treated equally with domestic holders, for better or worse. At the time of this writing, no decision appears to have been made and debt service payments are now delayed into the grace period. The lack of information is fanning market uncertainty. But the good news is that the authorities’ moves to manage the main problem — the domestic repercussions — reduce the risk of global contagion. We expect that as the domestic debt problems are resolved, along with social and financial system issues, the treatment of the offshore dollar bonds will be addressed.
The market seems to view the treatment of the offshore dollar bonds as a signal of China’s intentions about the treatment of domestic and foreign investors in general, reflecting a long history of discrimination between residents and non-residents in many countries. But we believe the issues are much more nuanced. Both foreign and onshore investors own domestic and offshore debt, which we believe means that any decisions by the Chinese authorities, Evergrande’s creditors in general, and its eventual management will not be as simple as categorizing different classes of creditor as subordinated or preferred. Instead, we expect the market to focus on the signalling around the decision, and we expect regulators, managers, and creditors in general to act in the best interests of the Chinese economy and society as whole rather than for or against any specific creditor by residency.
While markets seem to have calmed, there is always the potential for fears to rise again. And so will also want to monitor the global markets’ reaction to the evolving situation.
Medium-term implications for China’s property sector and overall economic growth. China has already shifted from an explicit formal growth target to a more qualitative idea of better, more inclusive growth that puts greater emphasis on values and income distribution rather than maximizing growth. Many Chinese leaders have expressed the view that property sector investment and speculation is a risky business at an individual level and for society as a whole. The authorities have also tightened regulation of various technology sectors, online gaming, and education — all of which have been highly profitable but have also exacerbated inequality and other social problems, just as they have in most countries around the world. These are common challenges, but many countries are choosing different ways to address them rather than a shared approach.
We expect China’s approach to reduce excessive investment and speculation in real estate, which may lower the growth rate but should also reduce leverage in the financial sector as well as the housing finance system. We do not see this as a major risk for the household sector as such, because all the available evidence, especially China’s very high savings rate of about 45% of GDP for Chinese households19 — suggests that household leverage, though it has been rising, should be manageable at a macro level.
We expect global markets may continue to be rattled as China develops its regulatory framework, but we also expect these changes to result in significantly lower concerns about China’s financial system, debt ratios, and the fear of a crisis.
Longer-term implications for growth. We expect all of this to translate into slower but more stable growth in China, but at the cost of less uplift to growth in the rest of the world, particularly regions that are reliant on rapid growth in investment and construction as well rapidly rising, concentrated wealth in China. Emerging markets, especially commodity exporters and those heavily integrated into China-facing supply chains, and the eurozone stand out, relative to the US, the UK, and some large emerging markets that have a trade deficit (India or Turkey, for example) rather than a trade surplus with China. Among countries with a surplus with China, those that are more exposed to the construction, investment and infrastructure cycle through metals and minerals exports (e.g., Brazil, South Africa, Australia) may be more directly exposed than say energy exporters such as Russia or Saudi Arabia.
None of this is to say that China’s growth will slow suddenly or sharply. The People’s Bank of China and the government remain in a strong position to stabilize growth and have the will to do so. We also expect the authorities to continue to focus on financial, economic and social stability, all the more so given the 20th Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in November 2022.
However, as China’s demographic transition to a rapidly ageing population with an already shrinking workforce combines with a more measured approach to growth and inequality in China itself, many of China’s trading partners may need to adjust to lower export volumes and possibly export receipts.
In turn, we believe this implies that, over the longer term, domestic policy decisions in those countries — both about managing their economies in the short term, as well as driving productivity growth in the longer term, will matter more to their economic and financial performance than the global growth environment, including China’s own cyclical position.

Addressing climate change isn’t new for the Democratic Party
The Biden administration is pushing hard to deliver on its clean energy vision.
Congress isn’t sitting on the sidelines
House and Senate Democrats are developing policies to create a cleaner, more equitable energy infrastructure.

Biden campaigned on the promise to fight the “existential threat” of global warming by pushing for policies that would eliminate greenhouse gases for the electric generation sector by 2035 and set the course for the country to be net-zero by 2050.
Addressing climate change is not a new priority for the Democratic Party, but it is widely believed to have crystalized support for Biden, particularly among younger voters. This solidarity of support has elevated pressure on the Biden administration to deliver on its campaign promise and restore US leadership in the fight against global warming.
Biden campaigned on broad themes to address climate change: create millions of clean energy jobs, reposition the US as a global climate leader, and transform the country’s economy while charting a course to net-zero emissions. But has he delivered?
Biden utilized the power of the pen on day one in office to sign Executive Orders to overturn several of President Donald Trump’s environment and energy actions, as well as reorient the federal government’s focus on achieving his cleaner vision for the economy. To date, Biden has largely signed Executive Orders or utilized memorandums of understanding directing agencies to create positions or take certain climate-related actions.

Multilateralism has returned with Biden
The US rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement and the World Health Organization on his first day as president.
Some US allies are skeptical
Could the effort toward multilateralism be undone in the next US election?

As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden promised to return the United States to activism on the international stage, chiefly by reinvigorating America’s traditional alliances and rejoining multilateral organizations and agreements that the Trump administration had abandoned. Thus far, President Biden has kept his word. While allies of the US have largely welcomed the return to a leadership role, there remains some skepticism regarding the staying power of this new policy direction.
As President-elect, Biden started reaching out to world leaders beginning with traditional allies and treaty partners: Canada, France, Germany, the UK, Ireland, Australia, Japan, and South Korea were among his first calls.
On his first day in office, Biden signed an Executive Order rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, putting the United States back into the international fight against climate change. Delivering on another day-one priority, Biden also rejoined the World Health Organization and with it, pledged US support of COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access), the international effort to ensure that vaccines are available to low- and middle-income countries. A month later, Biden participated in a virtual summit with the other leaders of the G-7, giving him a platform to project US re-engagement on the world stage.
Early into his tenure as Secretary of State, Antony Blinken announced that the United States would rejoin the United Nations Human Rights Council. While the council has come under intense criticism for its focus on Israel, and for including as members some nations that are viewed as serious human rights offenders, the view inside the administration is that the much needed reforms of the council are best made with the United States at the table.
Multilateralism is also evident in regional engagements by the president and other senior administration officials. For example, Biden participated in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, whose members include Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. While initially viewed with some uncertainty as a primarily regional security mechanism to contain China, the most recent meeting produced working groups on the COVID vaccine, critical technologies, and climate change.

Off to a bumpy start
The US laid down a tough public stance in meetings with the Chinese.
No clear path forward for US-China relations
The Biden administration’s China policy is a work in progress.

Everybody knows it’s cold outside in Anchorage, Alaska, in March, but not everybody knows how cold it can get inside a local hotel conference room.
The first high-level face-to-face meetings between the US and China got off to a bumpy start when the usually perfunctory opening comments and photo session for the meeting turned into an hour and 15-minute exchange of sharply worded critiques from both sides. At one point, Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared that China was “a threat to global stability.” Not to be outdone, Yang Jiechi, director of China’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission, responded that “the United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength.”
This exchange was the culmination of a week’s worth of diplomatic activity in Asia by the United States. The week began with a meeting of the leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue that includes Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, and continued with travel to South Korea and Japan by Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. All of this activity was designed to put China on notice that the United States would be making good on Biden’s campaign promises to repair alliance relationships and lean on multilateral institutions to confront China where necessary.
The mood was also soured by the imposition of sanctions by the United States on 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials for violations of human rights in Hong Kong. And that mood did not improve when, a few days after the meeting, the United States, Canada, UK, and EU all sanctioned Chinese officials for serious human rights abuses in Xinjiang in a coordinated fashion. While all this was met with handwringing by some Asia watchers in Washington, the tough and direct stance was welcomed by many others who acknowledge that a firmer hand with the Chinese by the US and its allies is warranted.
That is not to say the Alaska meetings were a bust. In fact, there are reports that once the cameras were off, the two sides found some issues on which progress could be made. Those included climate change, the nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran, and pursuing a peace agreement in Afghanistan. Perhaps it is possible to confront where appropriate and collaborate where possible. For example, in the context of Russia, the Biden administration reached a five-year extension of the New START Treaty (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) in February while simultaneously sanctioning Russia for allegedly poisoning opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
Still, the aftermath of Anchorage does not indicate a clear path forward for US-China relations, and the Biden administration’s China policy continues to be a work in progress. Nothing from the meeting sheds light on what the administration will do regarding the potential delisting of dozens of Chinese companies from US exchanges, nor does it point to a pathway for dealing with Huawei, ZTE, or other Chinese tech companies that many in Washington see as a threat to US national security. Further, there was limited clarity on whether the administration will ease any of the tariffs on Chinese goods.
What the meeting did produce, though, is some room to maneuver in Washington. By laying down a tough public line with the Chinese, some critics of the administration who expected the Biden team to be “soft” on China were left with little to criticize. China’s response to the meeting has made it clear that the Chinese intend to deal with the United States on their own terms.
Who moves next, and on what issue, remains to be seen. In the meantime, the Senate is at work on a bill designed to counter China’s push to become dominant in a variety of high-tech enterprises. There have also been calls for the US to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics that China is hosting. So, the next move on US-China relations could very well come from Capitol Hill.

Key takeaways
October has a rough reputation
A few historical crashes have made many investors wary about the month of October.
I see many reasons to be positive
While there are certainly some issues to watch this October, I see several reasons for optimism in the longer run.
I’m optimistic about the path ahead
October sell-offs are possible, but I still believe stocks will finish the year higher than where they are now.

For those who don’t know me well, I must confess that I am a movie buff — and I enjoy bad movies almost as much as good movies because of their comedic value. One thing I learned long ago is that if you are looking for a bad movie, typically one need not look any further than a sequel. (As my 15-year-old daughter would say, “Facts.”) While there are always exceptions, movie studios tend to fast-track sequels because they know there is a built-in fan base, but sometimes that leads to rushed scripts and rushed production — and lots of unintended laughs. Cases in point include “Son of the Mask,” “The Next Karate Kid,” “Jaws 3,” and “Jaws 4” as well as “Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan.” As the mother of a 19-year-old who is convinced he wants to be a screenwriter, I take comfort in knowing that, if nothing else, he will probably always be able to find work writing scripts for sequels.
The reason I bring up sequels is because September was an awful month for stocks — the S&P 500 Index experienced its worst performance since March 2020. And it’s not just US stocks — global equities also suffered. That begs the question: where do we go from here? Will October be an ugly sequel to September? Or will it be the start of a new chapter for the market?
Four reasons why I’m positive on the stock market
Some strategists are pointing to technical models that suggest October could be a worse month for stocks than September. We all know that some terrible stock market sell-offs have occurred in Octobers past, so there is legitimate concern that this October might follow that script. But whether or not this month proves to be difficult for stocks, I feel strongly about the importance of staying invested in the stock market — and, for those with cash on the sidelines, looking for buying opportunities if there are sell-offs.
Following are some compelling reasons to be positive on the stock market, in my view:

Progress in the fight against COVID-19. COVID-19 cases have fallen more than 30% since late August, while new daily cases in the US have fallen 35% since Sept. 1.1 And Merck just announced that studies have shown molnupiravir, its experimental COVID-19 therapy, reduced hospitalizations and deaths by approximately 50%.2 This is very positive news, especially given the difficulty many countries have faced in fully vaccinating their populations. What makes the development of this therapy important is that other treatments for COVID-19 come in IV form or through injection, so it’s far more difficult to distribute them quickly and broadly (one must go to a hospital or medical clinic). This pill is being likened to Tamiflu, which has been very effective in lessening the impact of influenza.
Attractive valuations. While still not modest, valuations are more attractive than they were just a few weeks ago thanks to the sell-off. It feels as though much of the bad news is priced in, but arguably not all the good news.
Robust capital market activity. Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is up significantly. In fact, global M&A activity for the first nine months of 2021 exceeded $4.3 trillion, which is already more than the largest year of M&A activity on record.3 Initial public offering activity in the US is also significantly higher. This suggests business confidence and a lack of risk aversion.
Very accommodative monetary policy. The Federal Reserve remains quite dovish, resisting announcing the start of tapering in September. And even when it begins tapering, which will likely occur later this fall, the monetary policy environment should be extremely accommodative as the Fed has massive assets on its balance sheet. In fact, many major developed market central banks have bloated balance sheets — and that is not going to change any time soon. This should provide an environment that is supportive of risk assets. In addition, and importantly, Fed Chair Jay Powell has decoupled rate hikes from tapering, setting a higher bar for the former.

Again, this doesn’t mean we won’t see sell-offs in October, but I still believe stocks will finish the year higher than where they are now.
Five issues to watch this month
Here are just a few things to watch in October:

The US employment situation report. Initial jobless claims have been creeping up in recent weeks, which is causing some concern about the job market. I am eager to see what the September jobs report tells us when it’s released on Oct. 8. I have long said that this report could be the first to reflect some return to normalcy for American workers — enhanced unemployment claims for remaining states ended in early September and kids went back to school, easing child care pressures on parents trying to return to the workforce. A very disappointing jobs report could rattle markets, but I think it would only be a temporary setback for employment, given improvement in the fight against COVID-19. I am focused on wage growth, as that tends to create stickier inflation. However, even if we see significant wage growth, we will need to look carefully at which sectors it is coming from; as I have said before, I would not be as concerned if the wage inflation is coming from the service sector as I believe there is more flexibility to adjust wages downward in the future, given there is so much employee turnover in this space.
More drama on China Evergrande. The Chinese property developer faced another debt deadline today, with a $260 million dollar bond payment due Oct. 3.4 And today it requested a halt to the trading of its shares in Hong Kong, as it appears a deal to sell a majority stake in its property management business is in the offing. This suggests the company is attempting to restructure and meet its obligations, while Chinese regulators are focused on ring-fencing Evergrande, ensuring that there is no contagion; both are welcome news. I expect more developments on this front in coming weeks. The Evergrande saga is far from over.
Debt ceiling drama. If Congress is unable to raise the debt ceiling, it could certainly negatively impact stocks and bonds — especially if US debt is downgraded by one or more of the ratings agencies. And that’s what credit rating agencies have been warning could happen. Ratings agency Fitch warned that if the debt ceiling isn’t raised or suspended “in a timely manner, political brinkmanship and reduced financing flexibility could increase the risk of a US sovereign default.”5 I suspect there will be more scary headlines on this topic, but I ultimately expect the debt ceiling to be raised — it may be a situation where Democrats must singlehandedly raise it through reconciliation, but I believe it will get done, and a default and downgrade will be averted. Hopefully it will occur in the “timely manner” that credit rating firms are looking for.
US-China trade tensions. Early last week I had heard rumors that the US would be slowly and quietly rolling back tariffs imposed during the Trump administration — something I had expected to happen much earlier. But the US Trade Representative struck a more aggressive tone today, saying China is not meeting its obligations under Phase One of the trade deal. This could just be diplomatic theater; she also argued that the US needs for forge a “new course” in trade relations with China, so perhaps that still means a rollback of tariffs. We will want to follow this situation closely in the coming weeks. A rollback of tariffs could be a positive for both US and Chinese stocks.
Fed re-appointment questions. The odds that Powell will be re-appointed to his position as Fed Chair have decreased in the last several weeks. Betting site PredictIt indicated a 90% chance of reappointment for Powell as recently as Sept. 12; that is now down to 63% as of Oct. 3.6 Still not bad odds, but it’s worth contemplating what would happen if he is not re-appointed. To put it simply, the Fed would likely tilt more dovish. The upside risk is that investors could become more bullish because of increased confidence that the Fed won’t act aggressively and choke off the economic expansion underway. However, I think the biggest downside risk in this scenario is that markets lose confidence that the Fed will be able to control inflation. Now it’s important to note that this could play out for multiple months, since his term does not end until early next year.

And so while October inspires fear in investors because of its track record of a few high-profile crashes, we must remember that most Octobers are fairly sanguine. Having said that, October 2021 could be an ugly sequel. I certainly wouldn’t be surprised to see heightened volatility and nervous investors. But while I see bad movie sequels for their comedic value, I would view an ugly market sequel as a buying opportunity.

Over the past six years, approximately 40% of adults in the US couldn’t come up with even $400 to cover an unexpected expense if needed.1 Without short-term savings set aside to cover either a one-time emergency or a three-to-six-month setback, employees have historically made choices (including taking on more credit card debt and/or tapping into retirement savings) that can jeopardize their long-term financial futures.
The pandemic caused substantial disruptions to many people's finances, and an  alarming lack of cash on hand became an emergency in itself:

Building up enough emergency savings was the top source of stress (41%) for employees, even before their job security (39%).2
Employees with fewer than three months of living expenses in savings were 13 times more likely to take a hardship withdrawal from their retirement account than those who had the savings — and three times more likely to take a defined contribution (DC) plan loan.3
Although the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act offered employees access to retirement savings as a source of cash, many of the most vulnerable Americans still did not have enough in their retirement accounts to cover emergencies that lasted longer than two months.4

Many employers are aware of how significantly financial stress can negatively impact an employee’s total well-being (and the company’s bottom line) and want to help. However, in early 2020, just 27% of firms offered an employee hardship assistance program. The most common programs include: the ability to withdraw from after-tax retirement funds, swapping vacation or sick days for cash, and/or access employee compassion funds (funded by the employer and/or employee donations).5
More employers now realize that creating a well-thought-out emergency savings account (ESA) program can be a sustainable and effective option for all. Whether offered as a benefit to establish a savings account through payroll deduction (“bank ESA”) or within the retirement plan (“DC plan ESA”), paving the way for employees to easily set up and build emergency savings is a no-brainer.

Emerging market equities have long been a core strategic allocation for defined benefit plans and institutional investors. Yet, the asset class has largely remained untapped by most defined contribution (DC) participants. At year-end, it was offered as a core menu option by only 16.4% of DC plans, with an average allocation of just 1.6% of participant assets (when offered).1
The case to go global by adding emerging market equities to help deliver stronger participant outcome potential, however, remains compelling. Here are three reasons why it may be time to embrace a dedicated emerging market equities strategy.

1. Expanding — and diversifying — portfolio return potential

From a historical perspective, emerging market equities have offered an attractive long-term performance profile that has largely exhibited different return patterns than both US and international developed market equities. Although the asset class can be more volatile than developed markets, adding a long-term allocation as part of a well-diversified portfolio may help optimize overall risk-adjusted return potential.
2. Participant overreliance on US large-cap equities

US large-cap equities continue to dominate the average participant’s allocation — in much greater proportion than what these securities represent in terms of global equity opportunities. As of Dec. 31, 2020, the average DC plan asset allocation included 26.4% of assets in designated US large-cap, 5.2% in international, and 0.2% in emerging market equities.1 This means that most DC plan assets have minimal, if any, exposure to the approximately 84% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) that is generated outside of the US; 57% is from emerging markets.2
3. An international strategy alone may not be enough

Some plan sponsors may consider a broadly diversified international equities strategy as an effective way to “globalize a portfolio.” The reality is, however, that many broad international equities’ benchmarks include relatively small emerging market exposures. 
Emerging market equity strategies may offer an effective lineup addition for plan sponsors looking to enhance diversification and help narrow the range of participant outcomes. Today, plans can choose from a wide selection of time-tested strategies in an effort to help better prepare participants for retirement.

What can plan sponsors do to address cybersecurity risk overall and prepare for Department of Labor (DOL) audits?
The urgency is clear. Mitigating cybersecurity risk has never been more crucial — and protecting the personal data and assets of participants in defined contribution (DC) and defined benefit (DB) plans is an important aspect of being a plan fiduciary. 

Participant account takeover on a large scale is a looming fear among plan sponsors, recordkeepers, and other retirement providers. As employers navigate today’s “new normal” of working arrangements, 69% of  information technology leaders believe ransomware attacks will be a greater concern in a hybrid workplace, and 67% predict a rise in “back to office” phishing emails.1 Now, more than ever, it’s critical that plan sponsors, recordkeepers, other third-party service providers, and plan participants all actively engage in the effort to secure plan data.

In early 2021, the DOL issued its first-ever cybersecurity guidance, and has already begun its random audits of DC plans to test the depth of process and procedure used by employers and service providers to keep personal data protected. While it is too soon to tell whether the DOL will issue financial penalties, it is likely to recommend and require enhancements if the audit identifies deficiencies. 

In this article, we offer a framework to help plan sponsors manage cyber risk and prepare for the questions DOL auditors are already asking:2


Establish a written risk management strategy.

The ways we view and define retirement have undergone a philosophical change, reflecting a new “retire-mentality.” Multiple factors are at play — longer life spans, more active lifestyles, supporting or caregiving for family members, lack of traditional pensions, and rising health care costs — adding greater complexity to how people plan for, and live in, retirement.
When both US and Canadian participants in our 2021 Watch Your Language study thought about retirement, they envisioned time with family and friends, pursuing a hobby, and even part-time employment. But underneath it all was the (perceived) ability to control their own time, and the financial security to support their passions.

So, what do employees want from their plan sponsors to help them achieve these goals?

Our defined contribution language study highlighted the following key findings:

Today’s participants would rather achieve “retirement income” versus “retirement savings.”
Employees want to hear from their employers about how their retirement plan savings will translate into retirement income — and not just when they’re about to retire, or even five years out.
For plan sponsors offering a range of in-retirement options (distributions, investments, tools, and resources), the best way to frame it with US participants is to package the offering in a clear way — such as a “Retirement Planning Program.”
When it came to the terms used to describe what they’ll receive from their retirement savings, study participants preferred a clear line to be drawn between working life and retired life —and opted for terms not associated with working income, such as “paycheck.”

Key takeaways
Supply chain fears are brewing
In early September, three US companies provided earnings warnings because of supply chain issues.
But companies have been largely positive
Currently, 103 companies in the S&P 500 Index have issued earnings guidance for the third quarter, with 54% providing positive guidance.[1]
The impact won’t be felt evenly
Some industries and companies will be impacted more than others, which suggests to me that active management matters in this environment.

Last week in my blog, I mentioned a number of things to watch in October.  One area I didn’t include was earnings, but that’s because this topic deserves its own focus given the growing concerns about how big an impact supply chain issues and rising labor costs are having on companies’ earnings.
Fears have been brewing for some time.  In early September, three US companies – two paint and coating companies and a homebuilder – provided earnings warnings because of supply chain issues.  


One of the paint companies lowered its sales guidance, citing lack of availability of raw materials for preventing it from meeting demand for its paint. (In fairness, one of the reasons cited for the scarcity of raw materials was Hurricane Ida, which exacerbated supply chain issues.) 
The second paint company also warned that supply-chain issues are impacting its sales volumes and suggested it was increasing prices to compensate for the rise in raw material prices.  I think it’s important to stress that the company remains very positive, sharing that demand remains “robust” and “strong” sales are expected into 2022. 
Finally, the homebuilder also warned that supply chain issues have worsened in the back half of 2021 and that supply shortages have slowed its ability to complete the building of its homes, creating backlogs.

Since then, several other major companies have also warned about rising costs related to supply chain disruptions.

What are S&P 500 companies telling us about earnings?
But these warnings don’t mean that earnings season for the third quarter will be a disappointment.  After all, companies have become very adept at managing expectations in advance of earnings reports, and generally we haven’t heard real alarm and substantial guidance downward.  At this point in time, 103 companies in the S&P 500 Index have issued earnings guidance for the third quarter, with 54% (56 out of 103) providing positive guidance.1 This is well above the five-year average of 39%.1
Certainly, many companies have been impacted by supply chain disruptions, rising input costs and rising labor costs – but it’s a question of how much they’ve been impacted and if they’ve been able to pass on the increase in costs.  We can certainly glean some insights from the small number of S&P 500 companies – 21 to be exact – that have reported earnings thus far.  So far, 16 out of those 21 companies have reported a positive earnings per share surprise and 15 have reported a positive revenue surprise,1 even though many are facing headwinds from the factors we discussed.  On the third-quarter earnings calls that have occurred thus far, supply chain disruptions have been mentioned most often (15 of 21 companies reporting), with labor shortages and costs a close second (14 of 21).  Companies also mentioned COVID costs and impacts (11 of 21) as well as transportation and freight costs (11 of 21).1
European companies are facing similar challenges.  No matter where companies are, they are likely experiencing supply chain disruptions, higher input costs and some issues sourcing labor.  
Which sectors may be especially impacted?

However, some companies will be far more impacted than others. As my colleague Paul Jackson has pointed out, if all other factors are equal, a rise in cost will generally have the greatest impact on low-margin companies, which tend to be found in sectors such as transportation, general retail, construction and autos.  Companies that should be least impacted are those with wide profit margins, limited raw material costs and small workforces. That should include growth sectors such as tech and health care. Unfortunately, those sectors’ stock prices may temporarily suffer as bond yields rise. Financials may be the standouts in this environment, especially as these companies would welcome higher yields.  Another differentiating factor may be how much investment companies have made in technology to increase productivity.  

When will these factors be resolved?

Some of these factors will be worked out sooner than others.  Despite a lackluster jobs report for the month of September (which was due in part to a large loss in public sector jobs, especially in education), I continue to believe the labor market will normalize to a certain degree as some obstacles to returning to the workforce dissipate.

When it comes to the shortage of semiconductors in particular, that situation appears likely to improve soon, with projections for a return to normal levels of production by the second quarter of 2022.2 However, more general supply chain disruptions are likely to continue in the shorter term, especially if there are additional COVID waves, but the situation should improve as vaccinations and COVID immunity become more widespread.  

In general, supply chain disruptions and higher input costs seem likely to be relatively transitory. Labor costs are a different matter and will vary by industry, with higher wages in the services sector most likely to become transitory because of high employee turnover.

And so, for me, I’ll be paying close attention to this quarter’s earnings season, but I’ll be most concerned about companies’ guidance for the fourth quarter and beyond -- especially how long they expect these conditions to last. What seems clear is that some industries will be impacted more than others, and some companies more than others. All in all, this situation suggests to me that investors need to be selective and discerning, especially if these factors are expected to last an extended period of time, and that active management matters in this environment.

Key takeaways
We expect inflation to be transitory
However, our definition of transitory has expanded. We now recognize that we could see elevated inflation for as many as 12 to 18 months.
Tapering is not tightening
Tapering may remove some of the euphoria and excess liquidity we have seen in financial markets, but it shouldn’t tighten financial conditions.
Valuations remain challenged
Consequently, the opportunities we see center on fundamentals and upgrade potential.

Tapering, tightening and transitory inflation — as we enter the home stretch of an eventful 2021, these are some of topics that are generating questions from clients right now. Below, I answer the Top 5 questions we’re hearing, and give some perspective about these issues may potentially impact core fixed income portfolios.
1. Is inflation transitory?
Yes, we believe current elevated levels of inflation are transitory. But our definition of transitory has expanded. While we initially thought in terms of a three-month time frame, we now recognize that we could see elevated inflation for as many as 12 to 18 months as supply chain and labor market constraints work themselves out.
But though these disruptions could last longer than we anticipated, over the longer term, we expect to return to the same low-inflation environment we have experienced for the last two decades. In our view, the same natural forces that weighed on prices pre-pandemic remain in place today and have arguably been reinforced by the pandemic. These include aging demographics, globalization (i.e., cheaper goods from abroad) and technological innovation. New pandemic behaviors like work-from-home and the rise of e-commerce, for example, have only accelerated these longer-term trends. We believe they will once again dominate when supply chains and labor markets regain balance.
On top of these forces is a fourth and newer factor likely to keep inflation low: the growing debt burden on global governments. Increases in overall debt levels may be stimulative in the short run as cash transfers are spent, but as governments divert fiscal resources away from growth-oriented programs to pay down debt and raise taxes to finance debt payments, we believe high debt levels will ultimately hamper growth, and therefore inflation.
2. How will Federal Reserve tapering impact markets?
Our standpoint is that tapering is not tightening. Tapering may remove some of the euphoria and excess liquidity we have seen in financial markets, but it shouldn’t tighten financial conditions.
The Fed describes its current bond purchase program as “emergency relief,” so reducing bond purchases gradually at this juncture seems warranted since, from an economic perspective, the pandemic emergency of 2020 is behind us. 
We anticipate that the Fed will reduce purchases from $120 billion to zero from December 2021 to mid-2022.  During this tapering time frame, the Fed will have purchased more bonds than it did during all of QE2 in the 2010-2011 time frame. Back then, the Fed was criticized by some in the market for being excessive. 
By that comparison, the current level of tapering certainly isn’t tightening. We also believe that markets are well-prepared for this move and we don’t expect the same kind of turbulent market reaction that we saw during the 2013 “taper tantrum.” Perhaps most importantly, we expect the Fed to be flexible. If US employment concerns or speed bumps arise in the global economy — for example, in emerging markets — we believe the Fed won’t adhere to its tapering schedule as strictly as it might have in the past, but would be responsive and potentially slow its pace of tapering.
3. What will Fed tightening look like?
In terms of rate hikes, we believe the Fed will remain on hold for at least the next year. As we mentioned above, the Fed has faced strong deflationary forces in the past that have consistently thwarted its goals to raise interest rates, essentially capping the federal funds rate in the 2% to 2.5% range in recent history. We believe this time will be no different.
As we reach the end of 2022 and early 2023, we expect inflation to normalize around its pre-pandemic levels, leading the Fed to consider rate hikes. But we believe the upside for inflation will be limited to the 1.5% to 2.0% range over the medium term, constrained by the structural forces mentioned above. As it has in the past, this environment would likely limit the potential for rate hikes beyond the 1.5% to 2.0% range for the federal funds rate.
We also believe the Fed will be slow to raise interest rates to avoid threatening the economy’s recovery. Having guided the economy this far out of the pandemic, we don’t think it serves the Fed to be too hawkish, unless inflation proves to be more persistent than expected, but that is not our base case.
4. Where do you see investment opportunities?
We recognize that valuations remain challenged across most asset classes. Consequently, the opportunities we see center on fundamentals and upgrade potential.
In high yield, in particular, fundamentals are about as good as they have been in recent years, in our view. The high yield default rate, which is a key indicator of corporate credit health, is expected to be less than 1% this year, a very low rate by historical standards. High yield and investment grade debt metrics are also better than they were at the end of 2019, as companies have paid down debt and growth has shrunk their relative debt burdens. As a result, we expect ratings upgrades to be a catalyst for bond market performance in the coming months. While companies have de-levered and boosted their credit profiles, rating agencies have been slow to recognize this improvement. We believe they are taking a cautious approach, waiting for the impact of the pandemic to be fully behind us. Once the coast is clearer, we expect a wave of upgrades that will likely send several high yield names into investment grade territory. This should not only create price appreciation potential but also broaden the potential buyer base for upgraded names. We call this dynamic a positive “market technical” and believe it should favor a number of credits. In the US, three sectors that we believe should especially benefit from “overdue” upgrades are large-cap technology names, home builders and consumer cyclicals (such as autos). We also favor non-agency residential mortgages in the structured debt space, given solid US housing market health.
In terms of global opportunities, we view the recent volatility in Asian markets as a potential opportunity to pick up high-quality credits that may have been unfairly punished in the market turmoil.
5. What is your longer-term outlook for interest rates?
To answer that question, we think you have to think globally. Any increase in yields in the US has tended to be met with strong demand from European and Japanese investors struggling with negative interest rates in their regions. In order for US rates to rise significantly, we believe we would need to see significant rate increases in Europe and Japan, which we don’t expect anytime soon. Europe and Japan face structural factors keeping their interest rates low and, therefore, we expect their demand for US government bonds and credit to remain strong for some time.
We also expect strong demand from large US institutional investors like insurance companies and pension funds, who would likely welcome higher rates. Together, we believe strong global and domestic demand for US fixed income should have a tempering effect on US interest rates over the longer term.

The investment grade bond market posted generally flat returns during the third quarter, which may give the impression that things were quiet during the summer months. That may have been true during August, but July and September were anything but quiet.
A decline in interest rates (and rise in bond prices) during July was driven by concerns around the trajectory of economic growth as the Delta variant driven spike in Covid-19 cases raised fears of renewed lockdowns.

The 2021 Invesco Global Factor Investing Study continues our research into global factor investing, a form of investing in which securities are chosen based on attributes that have tended to offer favorable risk and return patterns over time.
This year, we surveyed over 130 institutional investors and 111 retail investors collectively responsible for managing over $31 trillion in assets (as of March 31, 2021) to identify four themes behind the drivers of factor investing, investor experiences, and methods of implementation:

Theme 1: Increasing focus on the potential benefits of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incorporation leads investors toward a factor-based approach

Around half of factor investors are using factor investing to help incorporate ESG, driven by the pursuit of enhanced investment performance and control over exposures.

Factor investing is seen as more compatible with ESG than a market-weighted approach, but behind fundamental active; despite this, ESG is more likely to be pushing investors toward factor investing than fundamental active.

Respondents expressed a widespread belief that ESG can potentially enhance performance, while there is a lack of consensus as to whether ESG itself should be defined as an investment factor.

Investor demand for ESG factor products is clear. However, a lack of products and challenges around communication remain.

President Joe Biden’s Fiscal Year 2022 budget proposal encapsulated his big and bold campaign promises: reinvest in America (its roads and bridges and people, too). The 2022 budget put vision to paper, laying out in greater detail the president’s plan for traditional hard infrastructure (American Jobs Plan, or AJP) and soft or human infrastructure (American Families Plan, or AFP). Both proposals call for increased federal spending at over $4 trillion.
Presidential budgets typically receive praise from the president’s party and criticism from the other side of the aisle, but the lanes quickly converge into one: a joint depositing in the trash bin. This is largely because the budget release often coincides with the Treasury Department’s “Green Book,” a document that outlines the various financing and tax mechanisms that an administration will need to use to pay for presidential priorities. In other words, while the president’s budget is aspirational, the Green Book is a map of how to pay for it, and Congress ultimately has the tough task of merging the two by passing authorizing legislation as well as determining the right “pay-fors.”

Key takeaways
Four main types of inflation expectations
Inflation expectations are what people think inflation will be in the future, but “people” can be consumers, business owners, economists, or even markets.
Short-term versus long-term expectations
The conventional wisdom is that a rise in short-term inflation expectations can be tolerated so long as longer-term inflation expectations are well-grounded.
Remaining questions on inflation
Will the Federal Reserve tolerate medium-term inflation expectations not being well-anchored? And what influences inflation expectations?

The word on everyone’s lips these days is “inflation.” I personally haven’t heard so many references to inflation since I was a young girl wearing bell bottoms and listening to Bee Gees albums. These days, many of the questions touch on expectations. Many clients are confused by the fact that inflation data shows elevated prices, but the Federal Reserve keeps insisting that inflation is transitory because expectations are “well-anchored.” So I thought I would try to answer what inflation expectations are and what role they play in monetary policy for central banks.
Four main types of inflation expectations
Simply put, inflation expectations are what people think inflation will be in the future. “People” can be consumers, business owners, economists, or even markets, and there are a variety of different ways to measure those expectations: 

Consumer expectations. There are a number of survey-based gauges of consumer inflation expectations. A commonly used one comes from the University of Michigan, which each month provides expectations for both the one year ahead and five years ahead. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also conducts a monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations, which provides inflation expectations for the one year and three years ahead. 
Business expectations. There are also some survey measures of business inflation expectations. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta measures business inflation expectations by surveying firms — but only in its district. Another survey, the Survey of Firms’ Inflation Expectations (SoFIE), was created rather recently — in 2018 — but queries a large group of chief executive officers from all around the United States. SoFIE provides information on business leaders’ inflation expectations for the year ahead, as well as long-term inflation expectations, perceptions of recent inflation rates, inflation uncertainty, and even belief about the Federal Reserve’s inflation target. The survey covers firms in both the manufacturing and services sectors. One drawback is that the survey is only performed quarterly.
Economist expectations. There are many surveys conducted of professional forecasters. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia conducts a quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters, which provides economists’ assessments of future inflation, both short-term and long-term. The European Central Bank also conducts a quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters about inflation expectations for the short and medium term.
Market expectations. The market’s views are far more up-to-the-minute than survey-based inflation expectations, as they are based on financial instruments. For example, we can interpret the market’s expectations for inflation over various time periods by looking at the breakeven inflation rate. This is the spread — or difference — between the yield on Treasuries and the yield on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) for the same maturity. (TIPS were created in 1997 to offer an asset class specifically designed to help investors attempt to hedge against inflation). There are of course other market-based gauges of inflation expectations. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland — which has a Center for Inflation Research — has developed a complicated inflation expectations model that utilizes both markets and surveys, relying on Treasury yields, inflation data, inflation swaps and inflation expectations surveys.

Why do inflation expectations matter? 
These expectations are important because central banks believe they can influence decisions that impact the economy. I like the simple explanation provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland: “Inflation expectations are what people expect future inflation to be, and they matter because these expectations actually affect people’s behavior. It’s easy to understand how things in the past impact what I do today. Expectations about the future can also impact what I do today. For example, I may not buy a house, I may not invest in a piece of equipment or expand my business, or I might do it all, depending on my expectations.”1 
And it’s not just about inflation expectations influencing a decision on whether to buy a house. Academics such as Edmund Phelps and Milton Friedman believed that if employees expect higher inflation, they would demand higher wages, which would in turn cause companies to raise prices. This would create an ugly phenomenon called the wage-price spiral. A case in point is the 1970s, when inflation expectations became completely unglued. And that’s why inflation expectations play an important role in the decision-making of many central banks, including, of course, the Fed.
But there’s an important difference between short-term and longer-term inflation expectations. The conventional wisdom is that a rise in short-term inflation expectations can be tolerated by central bankers so long as longer-term inflation expectations are well-grounded, as that would be unlikely to alter consumer and business behavior. 
Fed Chair Jay Powell asserts that longer-term inflation expectations are well-anchored because, even though consumers expect inflation to be quite elevated in the year ahead, they expect it to be closer to the Fed’s target in the five years ahead. The preliminary October readings for University of Michigan consumer inflation expectations for the one year ahead is 4.8% and for the five years ahead is 2.8% — still above the Fed’s inflation target but well below short-term inflation expectations.2 Other gauges of inflation expectations have also indicated that longer-term expectations are better anchored than in the short run, although still high.
Remaining questions on inflation
But many questions remain about inflation expectations. For one, will the Fed tolerate medium-term inflation expectations not being well-anchored? The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations shows medium-term inflation expectations rose to 4.2% in September — which is a series high.3 That suggests that ‘transitory’ inflation might last three years or more. At this juncture, the Fed seems willing to tolerate higher medium-term inflation expectations so long as they remain well-anchored in the longer run, but we will want to follow this closely. I should note that the same New York Fed Survey shows five-year inflation expectations at the same level they were prior to the pandemic, which I believe makes a compelling case for the view that longer-term expectations remain well-anchored.
And which inflation expectations does the Fed care about most? It seems that the Fed cares about all of them. In fact, the Fed recently developed an Index of Common Inflation Expectations (CIE) which includes 21 different measures of expectations including consumer surveys, economists’ forecasts and market-based indicators. Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida has even referenced this index, saying that he is following it closely.
And what influences inflation expectations? The reality is that relatively little has been explored about the drivers of inflation expectations, especially in the long run. I believe confidence in the Fed’s ability to control inflation certainly plays a role; and so perhaps a taper announcement soon could help bolster confidence in the Fed’s ability to maintain inflation near its target goal over the longer term. Conversely, I suspect scary headlines could play a very significant role, which does not bode well for keeping longer-term expectations well anchored.
I look forward to addressing more about inflation expectations in an upcoming blog.

President Joe Biden was in Europe in mid-June with one goal in mind: show that America is back and willing to lead on the international stage. The point of this exercise was to provide a counter to the narrative being advanced by the Chinese government: the west is in decline, China’s economy and government are superior, and China should lead the way in international affairs in the 21st century. The recent G-7, EU, and NATO summits all responded by singling out China in their communiques for human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, describing China as a security challenge for the western alliance and vowing to push back on predatory competition from China. In fact, with regard to NATO, not only is this the first time China has been mentioned in a summit communique, but the alliance has been tasked with writing a new “Strategic Concept” for NATO that would address the security challenges China presents. 
But before the Biden team sings kumbaya, let’s take a look at some issues involving China where the US and some of its European partners diverge. In France, President Emmanuel Macron continues to advocate for a European security posture that relies less on the US. In particular, he is not interested in NATO focusing its attention on China, calling it a potential “distraction.” In addition, China continues to be Germany’s largest trading partner. Chancellor Angela Merkel has looked the other way on China issues when economic growth is involved. That could change with a new government coming later in the year, particularly if there is Green Party involvement, which could lead to Germany having a stronger voice on human rights issues. 
One of the EU summit outcomes that the Biden administration has been touting is the establishment of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council. The point is to assert western dominance over standard-setting in new technologies, but both sides will have to overcome some distrust on these questions, starting with the dispute over transatlantic data flows. The ceasefire in the Boeing/Airbus trade battle is a good starting point, but more work needs to be done. Biden’s democracy summit later this year will be an opportunity to build on these earlier summits, but there is still some distance to travel if the democratic countries are to present a truly united and effective challenge to China. 
Just before Biden departed for Europe in June, the Senate weighed in on the China debate by passing the United States Innovation and Competition Act. A mammoth bill, it authorizes $110 billion for basic and advanced research in such areas as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing, biotechnology, and advanced energy in an attempt to counter China’s economic rise and develop a national security strategy to address the challenges posed by China. While the Senate passed the bill (68-32) in a rare show of bipartisan support, the path forward in the House is less clear. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks (D-New York) has introduced his own bill focused on what the US can do in the foreign policy arena to counter China. Other House committees are also working on China-focused legislation, but whether the House will assemble the work product of several committees into one large bill, as the Senate did, remains unclear.

Much has been said and written about the aggressive first 100 days of the Biden administration. The dozens of executive orders and nearly $2 trillion in federal spending did much to reveal the principles and policies that can be advanced under unified Democratic control. However, beyond the response to the pandemic, arguably no issue has received more immediate focus and energy than climate change.
On Earth Day, President Joe Biden fulfilled a campaign promise and announced a new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Accord to cut emissions by 50% to 52% before 2030.1 To achieve that target, research shows that, among other steps, renewable power must quadruple; natural gas power plants must employ carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology; new buildings must be 100% electric; and electric vehicles (EVs) should make up 65% of new car sales by 2030. All of these transition steps will require a mixture of public and private capital if the NDC commitment is to be met. Further, Biden has made the American economy’s transition away from fossil fuels a key component of his agenda, driving action across a myriad of government agencies and departments.
A short list of those who have taken, or plan to take, action to implement this energy transition includes traditional lead agencies such as the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency. But many also expect initiatives from the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, among others. These departments and others like the General Services Administration (GSA) can use the power of procurement to drive cleaner energy and climate-driven Biden administration objectives.
Of particular interest to the financial services industry, and contained in Biden’s “all-of-government approach,” is the forthcoming work of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SEC Chair Gary Gensler has telegraphed that regulatory action requiring enhanced disclosure of climate risks by public companies will be near the top of his agenda, and the agency has already issued a request for information on an ESG Disclosure Rule. While the coming SEC action is presumed to be the centerpiece of the financial regulatory response to the calls for energy transition action, the Federal Reserve and the Financial Stability Oversight Council will also have a role to play as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen calls climate risk an “existential threat” to our financial system.
But the impact of these potentially significant actions by the federal government pale in comparison to the change that Congress can deliver if it can successfully legislate in this area. The significance of potential congressional action is the durability of the policy implications. As we have witnessed over the previous six months, Biden has used countless executive orders and started the process of rolling back Trump-era energy and environmental policies. But despite this approach, it is legislation that can stand at least beyond his presidency and potentially for generations.
Consider the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The law has been challenged in courts for over a decade and attacked via legislation by Republicans, but many aspects of the ACA still stand. As Republicans and Democrats in Congress appear to be in the final stages of bipartisan negotiations over an infrastructure package, which could carry significant energy transition policy reforms, the potential generational impact cannot be underestimated. Should a bipartisan agreement be reached, it is possible that legislation could address mass transit electrification and expansion, EV infrastructure improvements, and an upgrade of the electrical grid. That is, of course, unless politics get in the way and Democrats are forced to pursue a one-party approach.
While the Green New Deal and many aggressive climate initiatives would undoubtedly be featured in a Democrat-only infrastructure deal, the path for getting something to the president’s desk is perilous with a House majority of four seats and a 50-50 Senate. Indeed, the sheer variety and number of executive actions issued thus far to address the energy transition reveal a skepticism that Congress will ultimately deliver on the change that Biden has demanded.

Iranians went to the polls on June 18 and, as expected, elected the hardline head of Iran’s Supreme Court, Ebrahim Raisi, as their next president. Raisi is thought by many observers to be in line to become the next Supreme Leader as he is an ally of Iran’s current Leader, Ali Khamenei. With conservative clerics firmly in control in Tehran, where does this leave the Biden administration’s efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)?
There have been six rounds of talks in Vienna, although the US and Iran are not talking directly to each other. Instead, the Europeans are passing messages back and forth between the two sides. Accounts of progress on reviving the deal vary, with the Iranians publicly saying important progress has been made while the Europeans and Americans have been largely silent. The Biden administration’s hope is not only that Iran return to compliance with the JCPOA, but also that its government agrees to talks covering a wider range of issues including their ballistic missile program, support for non-state actors and terrorist organizations in the region, and the fate of Americans in Iranian prisons.
For their part, Iran is interested in broader sanctions relief from the US and international community but remains uninterested in discussions covering topics other than its nuclear program, as Raisi made clear just days after his election victory. The Iranians have also asked for a “guarantee” that if they enter a revived JCPOA, future US administrations will be unable to withdraw from it as President Donald Trump did in 2018. The Biden administration cannot bind future administrations without presenting the agreement in the form of a treaty and getting two-thirds of the Senate to agree — an outcome no one thinks is possible. So the administration has been clear that it intends to follow the same path as President Barack Obama in making this an executive agreement (and not subject to the approval of Congress.)
Raisi assumes office in early August, so one theory holds that Iran would be agreeable to a deal before he formally becomes president. The thinking is that if there is an agreement and if sanctions are lifted, then Raisi will be able to claim credit. On the flip side, if a deal falls through or the Iranian economy doesn’t rebound sufficiently, then he can blame the former president for the failure. The Biden administration has chosen to ignore who is president of Iran and focus on the fact that the current Supreme Leader is the same one who gave his blessing to the original deal in 2015. They are betting he does that again.
But there are skeptics in Washington, Jerusalem, and Riyadh who take Raisi at his word and do not believe that Iran will agree to a broader set of talks beyond the nuclear deal. The next few weeks will be telling as to whether Biden and his team can find a way to overcome what look like insurmountable obstacles.

A decade after Capitol Hill banned earmarks, Democrats in both chambers, joined by House Republicans, voted to revive the spending allocations in the current 117th Congress and rebrand the congressionally directed spending as “community project funding.” But it won’t be business as usual this time around — there are new guardrails designed to protect taxpayers such as a limit on lawmaker requests, online transparency, and an exclusion of for-profit companies.
Earmarks refer to language sought by individual lawmakers directing funds to specific projects or localities in their congressional districts or home states. Typically, the earmarked project would not always otherwise qualify for federal funding through formula or competitive agency grant awards. At the lawmaker’s request, a provision in a bill or committee report language is added, setting a specific discretionary spending authority. Projects are expected to fill a clear and present need in the community and demonstrate significant constituent and local government support.
Earmark scandals led to the 10-year congressional moratorium. Critics of the much-maligned “pork-barrel spending” are adamant that the practice leads to waste and corruption. Past examples include Alaska’s Gravina Island Access Bridge, which received hundreds of millions of earmarked dollars in the 2000s before it was finally scrapped and dubbed the “bridge to nowhere.” And there was disgraced former Representative Duke Cunningham (R-California) who was convicted of taking bribes to steer funds to defense contractors.
Supporters of earmarks argue that elected lawmakers are better equipped than unelected agency bureaucrats to decide which local projects are important enough to receive federal assistance. By giving Congress latitude to exercise its power of the purse, earmarks help the historically dysfunctional annual appropriations process move forward and shore up support from rank-and-file members.
In late February, the House Appropriations Committees announced a set of reforms that build on existing House rules and prioritize accountability, transparency, and strong community support. The committee will enforce a cap on overall funding at no more than 1% of discretionary spending, nearly $14 billion based on fiscal year 2021. Each member is able to make a maximum of 10 requests, must post those requests online, and must certify that neither they nor their family members have a financial interest in the projects requested. Additionally, earmarks are limited to state and local governments, and nonprofits, that carry out quasi-government functions, and there will be a mandatory audit conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on a sample of the funded projects, which will be reported to Congress. Similarly, the Senate Appropriations Committee, led by Democrats, will follow the existing requirements for congressional-directed spending, and has implemented the same reforms as the House with the exception of limiting the number of member requests. Senate Republicans, however, decided to keep their earmarks ban but installed a new, internal GOP rule that demands spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt ceiling. Neither the earmark ban nor the debt ceiling language is binding — and that means there is nothing to prevent individual senators from requesting earmarks or voting to raise the debt ceiling without corresponding cuts. A number of Senate Republicans already plan to propose earmarks, particularly top appropriators who oversee spending for a third of the federal budget.

Key takeaways
Leading economic indicators continue to decelerate at a moderate pace across regions
Despite this, we believe growth expectations are likely to improve over the remainder of the year.
Despite the negative headlines around Evergrande, we don’t expect contagion risk to spread beyond local high yield debt markets
It’s worth noting that emerging market equities have matched the performance of developed market equities over the past two months.[3]
While inflation is likely to remain well above target in the next few quarters, we believe it has peaked
This view is also consistent with central banks’ projections and consensus expectations from economic forecasters.

Despite the weakening in global leading economic indicators, our framework still points toward an expansionary regime. We believe growth expectations are likely to improve over the remainder of the year, extending this expansion by a few more months.
We maintain a higher risk posture than our benchmark,1 favoring equities, credit, cyclical factors/sectors, and emerging markets. We have reduced our underweight in the US dollar, given negative growth surprises outside the US, capping near-term foreign currency appreciation.
Macro update
Leading economic indicators continue to decelerate at a moderate pace across regions. However, the breadth of this deceleration is narrowing across parts of the economy. In the United States, weakness remains concentrated in consumer sentiment surveys, while business surveys, manufacturing activity, and housing indicators have improved in recent months. We see the gradual re-steepening in the yield curve as a positive sign in the medium term, incentivizing credit creation by the financial sector and supporting future economic growth. In the eurozone and the UK, peaking production expectations and falling inventories suggest the rebound in the inventory cycle has run its course. Eurozone manufacturing business surveys, a key bellwether of the global cycle given the high exposure to global trade channels, continue to signal elevated activity, and are yet to presage a clear downturn in the cycle. In Asia, deceleration in manufacturing surveys, housing indicators, and industrial production have contributed to a noticeable slowdown in growth, with business surveys for manufacturing and service sectors in China suggesting below-trend growth in the near term. 
Despite this broad-based softening in economic data, our macro regime framework remains in an expansionary regime, driven by our assessment that global risk appetite remains on a rising trend despite the moderate weakness in global equity markets over the past few weeks. Based on our framework, we believe growth expectations are likely to improve over the remainder of the year, extending this expansion by a few more months (Figures 1, 2, and 3).

Key takeaways
Midstream equities outperformed the broader markets in September
Energy was the only market sector that generated positive returns over the month, as commodity prices hit multi-year highs.
Strong commodity prices are driving increased drilling and completion activity
This is expected to translate into improved volumes for midstream in the future.
Natural gas prices hit multi-year highs in September.
This is supported by strong Asian and European demand, lower than normal seasonal inventories, and generally flat overall natural gas production in the US.

Midstream equities outperformed the broader markets in September, and energy was the only market sector that generated positive returns over the month, as commodity prices hit multi-year highs. Such strong commodity prices are driving increased drilling and completion activity, particularly among private companies, which is expected to translate into improved volumes for midstream in the future.
MLP market overview

Midstream MLPs, as measured by the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), ended September up 3.0% on a price basis and after distributions are considered. The AMZ outperformed the S&P 500 Index’s 4.7% total return loss for the month. The best-performing midstream subsector for September was the Compression group, while the Propane subsector underperformed, on average.
For the year through September, the AMZ is up 30.9% on a price basis, resulting in a 39.2% total return. This compares to the S&P 500 Index’s 14.7% and 15.9% price and total returns, respectively. The Gathering and Processing group has produced the best average total return year-to-date, while the Propane subsector has lagged.
MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-Year US Treasury Bond, narrowed by 50 basis points (bps) over the month, exiting the period at 624 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 696 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 430 bps. The AMZ distribution yield at month-end was 7.7%.
Midstream MLPs and affiliates raised no new marketed equity (common or preferred, excluding at-the-market programs) and issued $2.2 billion of new debt during the month. No significant net new asset acquisitions were announced over the month by US midstream names, but a Canadian-listed industry participant acquired US midstream assets for $3.0 billion.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil exited the month at $75.03 per barrel, up 9.5% over the period and 86.5% higher year-over-year. Natural gas prices ended September at $5.87 per million British thermal units (MMbtu), up 34.0% over the month and 132.2% higher than September 2020. Natural gas liquids (NGL) priced at Mont Belvieu exited the month at $48.11 per barrel, 20.2% higher than the end of August and 152.9% higher than the year-ago period. 
News

Several industry participants announced clean energy and emissions initiatives. Williams (NYSE: WMB) and Orsted (NYSE: ORSTED DC) announced a plan to explore clean energy projects in the US including a large-scale wind farm, electrolysis, and synthetic gas-via methanation. Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) plan to study and evaluate opportunities for carbon capture, utilization, and storage from their respective business operations in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast. ONEOK (NYSE: OKE) announced plans to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 30% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels. Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) and Southwestern Energy (NYSE: SWN) announced the initiation of a responsibly sourced natural gas (RSG) strategic agreement whereby SWN will produce and KMI will transport the RSG on its pipeline infrastructure. KMI also announced a partnership with Neste (NYSE: NESTE FH) to create a storage and logistics hub in Harvey, Louisiana supporting increased production of renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable feedstock for polymers and chemicals. Finally, Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET) signed a 15-year deal to purchase solar power from the Eiffel Solar project in northeast Texas, ET’s second significant agreement to purchase solar power to meet its ERCOT load requirements.
Enbridge acquires Moda. Enbridge (NYSE: ENB CN) announced the acquisition of liquids terminaling and logistics company Moda Midstream at an enterprise value of $3.0 billion. Moda’s primary asset is the Moda Ingleside Energy Center, the nation’s largest crude export terminal by volume with an aggregate storage capacity of more than 15 million barrels and an export capacity of 1.6 million barrels per day with direct connectivity to next-generation long-haul crude pipelines, including Cactus I, Cactus II, Gray Oak, EPIC, and the Harvest Ingleside pipeline. 
Chart of the month: Natural gas prices hit multi-year highs

NYMEX natural gas pricing exited September at $5.87 per MMbtu, the highest closing price for the commodity since February 2014. Strength in natural gas pricing is currently being driven by strong Asian and European demand, lower than normal seasonal inventories, and generally flat overall natural gas production in the United States. Crude oil and natural gas liquids pricing have also hit or are nearing multi-year high levels. Collectively this strong commodity pricing has driven increased industry activity, which is expected to manifest in stronger midstream throughput and, ultimately, stronger midstream cash flow generation.

Brian Levitt
Global Market Strategist
Key takeaways
My view on inflation has evolved
I underappreciated the adverse effects of turning the economy on like a light switch before businesses had time to rebuild inventories and bring back workers.
Inflation may not be as transitory as I’d hoped
I still expect inflationary pressures to moderate over time, but right now, the risks to the stock market and the economy are elevated
Progress takes time
I view this as a unique moment in time driven by a once-in-a-century pandemic, and it will take time to work through the challenges.

I have found myself working my way from denial to acceptance of the inflation situation. It’s almost reminiscent of the Kubler-Ross Model — denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance — although I’m by no means equating the evolution in my thinking with the process of grieving. Rather, what strikes me has been my need to progress through distinct stages to get to the acceptance that inflation may be less transitory than initially hoped.
Below are the stages that I’ve been through on my way to acceptance of the inflation situation. Read along for a look inside my thought process as the inflation picture became clearer over the course of this year—and what I’m expecting to see going forward.
Stage 1: Denial
Inflation wasn’t on my mind in the early days of the pandemic. After all, shutting down large segments of an economy is inherently deflationary. As demand falls, then prices fall, then wages fall, then demand falls, and so on, in what could become a potentially vicious cycle. Policymakers responded to protect the global financial system and to bridge the hardest hit US businesses and households through what would prove to be a very difficult time. I applauded their efforts and shuddered to contemplate the outcome of a less forceful response.
Stage 2: Frustration
As stimulus checks were deposited into Americans’ bank accounts, inflation concerns started to bubble to the surface. But in my mind, the naysayers were overstating the inflation risk. Survey after survey has suggested that Americans have been treating the government support as income replacement, and not as an excuse to go on a spending spree.1 In fact, a large majority of Americans report using the assistance to add to savings or to pay down debt. As for the concerns that “coddled” Americans won’t return to the workforce, the economy has added over 5 million jobs this year, with all but 194,000 of those jobs coming before the extended unemployment benefits lapsed in early September.2
Stage 3: Bargaining
We started to see price increases in the consumer basket, but the biggest ones could all be easily explained. Rental car prices were up because the rental car companies had shed much of their fleets just as Americans were returning to travel. Lodging prices were up as we unleashed our pent-up demands to get out of the house.3 But I didn’t expect that to persist — how many vacations can we take? Plus, the market has been taking it all in stride. The 10-year US Treasury rate is below its 2021 peak in late March.4 For all the concern about longer-duration equities and speculative growth companies (businesses that are likely to be more adversely affected by inflation because they receive their cash flows well out in the future), the Russell 1000 Growth Index is up over 15% this year.5
Stage 4: Humility
Reality starts to bite. There’s more than enough anecdotal evidence of price increases to suggest that the supply-chain problems are real and will take time to alleviate. I underappreciated the adverse effects of turning the economy on like a light switch before businesses had time to rebuild inventories and bring back workers. Compounding the problem, many of the manufacturing hubs of the world, including Vietnam and Thailand, were dealing with their own COVID challenges as Americans were unleashing their pent-up demand.6 Freight costs have been rising significantly as vessels struggle to unload their wares at ports in a timely fashion.7 The bond market, which I believe gets it right more often than any other indicator, is taking notice. For example, the 5-year, 5-year forward inflation breakeven, an estimate of inflation expectations for the five-year period that begins five years from the present, appears to be breaking out as it did earlier this year.8

Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
What are the downside risks?
Policy error, persistent inflation and COVID variants top the list of investor concerns.
What are the upside risks?
Rising vaccinations, positive earnings surprises and a steady Federal Reserve are among the bright spots I see.

It’s time for Halloween, and that means my younger son and I have been watching a marathon of scary movies. For him, the more frightening, the better — although I do draw the line at some of the really gory ones. For example, “Texas Chainsaw Massacre” is verboten in our house, despite its cult status. Our annual Halloween movie marathon has caused me to wonder, “What is it about humans that makes them want to be scared? Do humans somehow enjoy being afraid?”
I’ve thought a lot about this in the last few weeks. I’ve been traveling and presenting, and have had the opportunity to interact with clients and financial professionals. It seems as if they want to be fearful — they’re all worrying about downside risks, but they’re ignoring the upside risks. I can understand the desire to be objective, to not miss risks because one is too optimistically biased. But what I am seeing now is a real pessimistic bias that is causing investors to focus on fear but not opportunity. Just last week, CNBC released a poll showing that only 31% of Americans believe it is a good time to invest in stocks, which is the lowest level since 2016.1 

To help us see the broader picture, I’ll summarize both the downside risks and the upside risks that I see today.

What are the downside risks?

There is a long list, of course, but I’ll focus on a few of the concerns that have come up most in my recent meetings with clients.
The potential for policy error. This is the risk that investors seem to worry about most. We all know that central banks have the power to end economic cycles by tightening too soon and too quickly, choking off economic growth. There is a very real fear that the Federal Reserve (Fed) could send the US into a recession — dragging other countries with it. This fear persists even though the Fed has done everything it can to demonstrate that it is not hawkish and that it will be patient.

Persistently high inflation. There is concern that inflation will not be transitory after all — but “transitory” is far from a precise definition. I think some believed “transitory” meant a few months, but it looks like this burst of inflation could last longer, probably until about mid-2022. Fed Chair Jay Powell said as much last week: “Supply constraints and elevated inflation are likely to last longer than previously expected and well into next year, and the same is true for pressure on wages.”2 But this is far from “permanent” inflation — there are a number of forces such as innovation and demographic trends that I believe will exert downward pressure on prices over the longer term.
COVID-19 variants. The strain inspiring fear right now is the Delta Plus variant, and with good reason. Despite a relatively high vaccination level, the UK has recently seen a large increase in new COVID-19 cases, and Delta Plus is being blamed for the spread. There is concern among health officials that it may be more contagious and, even worse, resistant to existing vaccines. Now, we’ve been here before — there were concerns that the Mu variant would be super-contagious and that existing vaccines wouldn’t protect against it. That proved to be wrong. We will of course follow this closely, but we need to recognize that even in a worst-case scenario, we are not going back to the dark days of early 2020 when the pandemic was new to the world and we hadn’t developed any defenses for controlling it.

US recession. There’s a general sense in the US that a recession is in the offing, which surprised me given this is such a strong job market for employees (they are so optimistic they are quitting their jobs in droves). A recent CNBC poll shows that 47% expect a recession over the next 12 months, while 79% say the economy is fair or poor.3 

China downturn. There is also concern that China policymakers’ increased regulation will cause China’s economy to deteriorate, dragging down the global economy with it. What’s more, I continue to hear market watchers say that, because of this heightened regulatory environment, China has become “uninvestable.” These types of statements scream to me that there may be a very significant buying opportunity.

What are the upside risks?

I see quite a few upside risks that many investors seem to overlook. 
The fight against COVID-19. The world is getting more successful in containing COVID-19 as the level of vaccinations around the world rises. For example, we’ve seen very substantial progress in Asia in just the last several months, with 69.94% of Japan’s population now fully vaccinated and 70.15% of South Korea’s population fully vaccinated. A number of emerging markets countries have also made significant progress, with 53.97% of Brazil’s population fully vaccinated; and 56.56% of Turkey’s population is now fully vaccinated.4 If no dangerous variants develop, then the world should continue to normalize toward pre-pandemic life.
A steady hand by the Fed. Powell spooked markets last week when he said, “The risks are clearly now to longer and more persistent bottlenecks and, thus, to higher inflation.”5 But what markets seemed to overlook was that he also said the Fed will “look through” that higher inflation in order to give the economy more time to heal. If the Fed were to keep rates lower for longer, choosing not to hike until late 2022 or early 2023, that would be more dovish than expectations.
Inflation that moderates more quickly than expected. Expectations for a brief rise in inflation are fading. But now that many are expecting a longer-term bout of inflation, it will be easier to beat those grim expectations. Supply chains won’t get back to normal overnight but supply chain bottlenecks could ease as there are fewer assembly line shutdowns due to COVID, semiconductor production ramps up, and the backlog of container ships in US ports is worked through.
Heightened regulation in China ends sooner than expected, and economic growth re-accelerates. The end of this period of regulatory reform in China may soon be in sight. That doesn’t mean current policies will be rolled back, but China policymakers may choose to forego much more in the way of regulation, as they will likely want to analyze the impact of the new reforms on the economy and markets. That could be a positive for the economy and help it to re-accelerate. In addition, investors may quickly realize that China is very investable.
Gridlock on taxes. Gridlock might not sound like an upside, but in this case, Congressional gridlock might mean that Corporate America avoids a much-anticipated tax increase. I believe that would be a real positive for stocks as most investors have assumed some tax hike.

Earnings surprises. Revenue and earnings could continue to positively surprise as they have for the 23% of S&P 500 companies that reported as of Friday.6 I think that will be the case for the third quarter, although admittedly I am more cautious about the fourth quarter.

Conclusion

So what does this mean for investors? As I mentioned at the beginning of this piece, only 31% of those polled by CNBC say now is a good time to invest in stocks, the lowest since 2016.7 That is music to my ears. Fears are high, expectations are low, and investors are fixating on all the downside risks. From my perspective, that simply means that the upside potential is higher.

QQQJ’s high-growth, mid-cap companies can and do grow large enough to “graduate” to be included in the Nasdaq-100 Index.

It’s understandable for investors to focus on the biggest, most successful companies, but what about the mid-cap companies whose biggest growth spurts may be ahead of them? While our flagship product, Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ) and one of our new offerings, Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQM), provide access to the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq, Invesco Nasdaq Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ) offers that approach with a twist: exposure to the next 100 largest companies listed on the Nasdaq (ex-financials).
With a mid-cap focus, the companies in QQQJ are defined by their high expenditures on research and development as a proportion of revenue, which could prime them for high future growth.
Research and development spending is a key measure of a company’s commitment to innovation. Research and development can lead to new discoveries, competitive advantages, and cost-saving measures.

Key takeaways
Since 1999, the NASDAQ-100 has significantly outperformed two other large-cap indexes.

The NASDAQ-100 provides exposure to more than just technology stocks.

For long-term growth investors, finding companies with a commitment to innovation is essential.


At the core of a portfolio, most investors want investment strategies with three key attributes:

An established record of delivering strong long-term performance
Diversification within your portfolio
An opportunity to pursue long-term growth

The Invesco portfolios that provide access to the NASDAQ-100 Index can potentially meet each of these criteria. The NASDAQ-100 are the 100 largest non-financial companies, ranked by market capitalization that are listed on the Nasdaq. The Invesco funds that provide access to this index are the Invesco QQQ ETF (ticker QQQ), the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (ticker QQQM), and the mutual fund, Invesco NASDAQ 100 Index Fund (ticker IVNQX R6 Shares).
Decades of strong large-cap performance
Since the Invesco QQQ ETF was introduced in 1999, the NASDAQ-100 has significantly outperformed two other indexes of large-capitalization stocks – the S&P 500 Index and Russell 1000 Growth Index. It’s important to remember that this is a period spanning significant episodes of market volatility – including the dot.com collapse of the early 2000s, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009, and the market volatility experienced during the early months of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Key takeaways
History has tended to reward those who maintain an unwavering long-term strategy.

The strength and strategic savvy of innovative sectors served them well.

Innovative companies have already begun looking to the future.


How innovation may drive growth stocks through volatile times
It’s human nature for investors to lose focus after an eye-popping market drawdown. As previous gains slowly slip away, investors often can’t resist trying to outmaneuver the market. But that could be the wrong move. History has tended to reward those who maintain an unwavering long-term strategy.
This resilient, but often challenging to implement, approach has worked particularly well when investing in sectors with a track record for innovation. Companies in these sectors are accustomed to adapting to a rapidly changing world by constantly developing new technologies and groundbreaking solutions. The recent performance of Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which provides access to the NASDAQ-100 Index, demonstrates this potential to handle periods of volatility better.
In the weeks during which the coronavirus outbreak became front-page news (February 19 through March 25), QQQ had slightly outperformed (at NAV) the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500 Index. This outperformance has been aided in part by two important factors.
First, QQQ didn’t have significant exposure to the broader market’s worst-performing sectors: energy and financials. Since the NASDAQ-100 doesn’t include financial services companies and has limited exposure to the energy sector, QQQ was mostly immune to the market’s more than 30% drawdown. 
Second, the rebound in QQQ is most likely attributable to the strength and strategic savvy of the innovative tech, biotech and communications leaders that are in the fund. When an unprecedented challenge like a worldwide pandemic hit, these well-positioned companies were prepared. Given that this particular crisis brought a dramatic increase in virtual vs. in-person experiences, many of the NASDAQ-100 companies, with their digital first business models, were able to thrive.

Matt Brill
Head of North American Investment Grade


There are three things fixed income investors should remember heading into the New Year, says Matt Brill, Head of North American Investment Grade for Invesco Fixed Income:
1. Tapering is not tightening. 
Matt’s view: The Federal Reserve is going to be injecting less liquidity into the system, but they are not tightening. So this is still good for corporations and overall corporate debt. Bottom line: We are not going to get a taper tantrum. The market is better prepared for this.
2. Anticipating the ‘overdue upgrade’
Matt’s view: High yield is due for an “overdue upgrade.” It’s time for rating agencies to get up to speed on where these companies should be rated — for many of them that’s the investment grade level.
3. Not all emerging markets are created equal 
Matt’s view: While there’s a lot of talk about both the opportunities and risks in emerging markets — especially in China — it’s important to remember that not all emerging markets are the same. Investors should assess each market individually rather than evaluating this area as a whole.

Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
Central banks take the spotlight
Central bank meetings in the US, England, and Australia are expected to create headlines this week.
Energy is a topic of discussion
As energy prices rise, a major climate change conference convenes in the UK, and OPEC+ decides their strategy amidst pressure to boost production.
What will we learn about jobs?
We anticipate the release of a key US jobs report this week, as well as more news on corporate earnings.

November is starting off with a flurry of activity. Central bank meetings in the US, England, and Australia are expected to create headlines. A major climate change conference kicks off in the UK against the backdrop of increasing energy prices. The world’s major oil exporting nations meet to decide their strategy amidst global pressure to increase production. Plus, we anticipate the release of a key US jobs report as well as more news on corporate earnings. Here are nine things I’m watching this week and beyond.
1. The Federal Reserve meeting
This may finally be the moment we have all been waiting for. The Fed is expected to announce the start of tapering at its meeting this week. There could be more volatility in advance of the meeting, but I think it will be minor. The Fed has over-communicated the fact that tapering will begin soon, so I think it’s already largely priced in. So I will be focused on Fed Chair Jay Powell’s press conference. I will be listening closely for any small changes in what Powell says.  Having said that, I don’t think the Fed will become spooked by inflation and change its “patiently accommodative stance.”. I expect it to continue saying what it’s been saying: Rate hikes have been decoupled from tapering, so we shouldn’t expect rate hikes to begin until the back half of 2022.
2. Bank of England meeting
The Bank of England (BOE) has been more hawkish than the Fed recently, and I expect it to raise rates at its meeting this week. The BOE’s meeting comes on the heels of the Bank of Canada’s meeting last week, when it surprised markets with a quick end to its large-scale asset purchase program. I think the BOE will follow suit. Even though some are arguing they won’t act for a few months in order to see the impact of the end of furlough assistance, I don’t think the BOE believes it has the luxury of time.  Some developed market central banks could be getting more hawkish, such as the BOE, but I believe the Fed will be a laggard.
3. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) meeting
Australia’s central bank also meets this week. This is an important meeting because the RBA failed to defend its bond yield target through asset purchases last week, resulting in a loss of yield curve control; this raises expectations that the central bank will formally end its yield target program at its meeting. 
4. COP26 meeting
The UK is hosting the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), which runs to Nov. 12. Cooperating to battle climate change has become more difficult with high energy prices. Some countries are feeling pressure to ease environmental regulations given the current environment of supply chain disruptions and higher energy prices.  Some countries have brought coal plants back on line as there is increased demand for electricity and natural gas prices have soared, while some countries have removed taxes on fossil fuels, essentially subsidizing them.  Keep in mind that when the Paris Climate Accord was signed on April 22, 2016, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil cost $44.23 per barrel, Brent crude was $45.59 per barrel, natural gas was $2.08 per million Btu, and coal was approximately $80 per metric ton.1 It’s a very different story today: WTI crude oil is $83.57 per barrel, Brent crude oil is $83.20 per barrel, natural gas is $5.54 per million Btu, and coal is $233 per metric ton.1
5. OPEC+ meeting
The pressure is increasing on oil-producing countries to increase production. Thus far, they have been very disciplined. When OPEC+ meets on Nov. 4, I suspect they will continue with that stance, only agreeing to a limited increase in production, meaning higher energy costs are likely to remain – at least for now.  One source of optimism is news that Iran will restart talks on its nuclear program, which could mean significant Iranian exports adding to supply and easing pricing pressure if some kind of deal can be reached.
6. More earnings announcements
Last week was when we finally saw a few high-profile earnings disappointments due to supply chain disruptions and higher labor costs. It wasn’t pretty – these were big misses for the most part – but markets barely flinched.  This week we will get reports from many companies, including some retailers, so wage growth will be top of mind.  Having said that, we want to follow wage growth closely because the longer this lasts, the more problematic it is likely to be for companies and investors.
7. The US jobs report
As I have said before, October’s jobs report (to be released Nov. 5) could be the first report that reflects more normalcy in the job market, given that it looks at employment from roughly mid-September to mid-October (after children have gone back to school and enhanced unemployment benefits have rolled off, and after the peak of the most recent COVID wave). September’s jobs report was a disappointment, but I have much higher hopes for October. We will want to pay close attention to wage growth, given that is an increasing problem for companies.
8. The Japanese stock market
Japanese markets will be digesting the results of the national election, which enabled new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to maintain a majority in Parliament, despite expectations that he would not be able to do so. This means he will likely be able to move his economic agenda forward, including fiscal stimulus. The initial stock market reaction has been positive, and I think this sentiment has legs; I believe this could be the start of a considerable stock market rally in Japan, fueled by improved sentiment.  After all, there is a high vaccination level in Japan (about 75% of the population is believed to be fully vaccinated, according to Reuters’ COVID-19 Tracker) and the economic re-opening is gathering steam.  For example, the mobility trend for restaurants, shopping centers and other retail businesses has improved and is only 6% below pre-pandemic levels.2
9. COVID cases
I keep hearing that the stock market doesn’t care any more about COVID, that we have moved past it. That’s a luxury we can have when COVID infections are in abeyance. But make no mistake — COVID remains a significant economic and market issue as any outbreak can cause the shutdown of an assembly line, plant or dock, especially in Asia where they take such outbreaks very seriously.

Key takeaways
Precious metals equities offer many of the same potential advantages as owning gold
Gold and precious metals mining equities offer the potential for capital appreciation, diversification, and wealth preservation, among other possible benefits.
We favor a longer-term and strategic allocation to the asset class over a short-term tactical one
For longer-term investors who are willing to look through the volatility, precious metals equities can potentially deliver attractive total returns.

Many investors recognize the case for owning gold in a portfolio — the potential for capital appreciation, diversification, and wealth preservation combined with a hedge against geopolitical turmoil and inflation. But what they might not know is that gold and precious metals mining equities (“precious metals equities”) can offer many of the same benefits, combined with the possibility of growth through the drill bit, leverage to rising metals prices, dividends, and optionality to participate in corporate actions (stock splits, mergers and acquisitions, rights issues, and spin-offs).
Potential for attractive total returns
In terms of our investment philosophy, we favor a longer-term and strategic allocation to the asset class over a short-term tactical one. There are two primary reasons for this. First, both gold and the precious metals equities can potentially offer a “safe haven” during periods of market turmoil, which are often unforeseen and difficult to predict. Second,  successfully timing any investment can be difficult, but it is especially hard with a higher-volatility asset class like precious metals equities. For longer-term investors who are willing to look through the volatility, however, precious      metals equities can potentially deliver attractive total returns. Although analyzing different time periods can generate varying results, in the nearly six years since gold reached its low of $1,050/oz in late 2015, the precious metals equities have delivered a 22.0% annualized return compared to 9.6% for gold, 17.3% for US stocks, and 3.8% for US bonds (Figure 1).

Key takeaways
Leading economic indicators have continued to decelerate at a moderate pace across regions
However, our macro regime framework remains in an expansionary regime, with global economic activity above its long-term trend and global risk appetite improving.
The recent repricing of monetary policy expectations across both developed and emerging markets has been impressive
We believe this signals a consistent view by market participants that impending tightening cycles are likely to be front-loaded and short-lived.
Yield curves have been flattening aggressively, with the long end unchanged or lower over the past few months
These dynamics are consistent with market expectations for a short-lived tightening cycle and a return to the low-growth, low-inflation, post-GFC world.

Our framework still points toward an expansionary regime. However, hawkish monetary policy repricing and flattening of global yield curves is a reminder of rising slowdown risks into 2022.
We maintain a higher risk posture than our benchmark,1 favoring equities, credit, cyclical factors/sectors, and emerging markets. We have further reduced our exposure to foreign currencies, given negative growth surprises outside the US.
Macro update
Leading economic indicators continue to decelerate at a moderate pace across regions. In the United States, weakness remains concentrated in consumer sentiment surveys, while business surveys, manufacturing activity, and housing indicators remain resilient. In the eurozone and the UK, slowing manufacturing demand expectations, rising inventories, and weak consumer confidence confirm the slowdown of the past few months. While China’s activity is likely to remain below trend growth in the near term, the negative momentum in manufacturing and real estate surveys is dissipating, suggesting some stabilization, while monetary and credit conditions are gradually improving. Our macro regime framework remains in an expansionary regime, with global economic activity above its long-term trend and global risk appetite improving (Figures 1a, 1b, and 2).

October proved to be an interesting month for bond investors as short-term bonds posted slightly negative returns while longer-term bonds rallied in price. This “twisting” of the yield curve, where short-term rates rise and long-term rates hold steady or fall, is yet another reflection of the havoc the emergence from the pandemic is having on the economy, and in turn, the bond market.
During the month, economists, market participants, and perhaps most importantly, Federal Reserve Officials, debated the meaning of the word “transitory.” Supply chain bottlenecks and labor shortages have contributed to a meaningful rise in inflation in recent months. Long thought to be a short-term phenomenon that would work itself out quickly (i.e. transitory), it appears that elevated inflation may be with us for several more quarters, or even years, making the definition of “transitory” a tricky one to handicap.

Key takeaways
It’s time once again to give thanks
There’s never a bad time to list reasons for being thankful. But this year, our annual Thanksgiving exercise feels like it takes on even greater significance.
There’s much for investors to celebrate
While we still face challenges ahead, this year I celebrate the global vaccine rollout, the booming US job market, and much more.

There’s never a bad time to list reasons for being thankful. But this year, our annual exercise feels like it takes on even greater significance. It was only a year ago that COVID cases were rising at catastrophic rates, and hospitalization and fatality rates were following in tow. Vaccines trial results were promising but still pending approval. The economic recovery had commenced but was still tenuous. What a difference a year makes.
As we approach Thanksgiving 2021, we recognize that challenges remain. The effects of the pandemic are still with us. COVID cases have come down meaningfully but are elevated.1 The prices of goods, including the cost of Thanksgiving turkeys, have risen as consumers unleashed pent-up demand on an economy struggling to rebuild supply.2 Many American families are still wary about gathering for yet another holiday. Nonetheless, substantial progress has been made in the past year and is worth celebrating. Instead of lamenting the fact that our lives are not yet back to “normal,” let’s instead focus on the true spirit of the holiday and remind ourselves of what we’re thankful for. 
Below is a list of 10 items that investors can be thankful for this year.
1. Vaccines have been rolled out globally
At last year’s Thanksgiving tables (many of which were outside or in garages), many families spoke longingly of a vaccine rollout at some future point. Since then, 194 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with another 31 million receiving at least one jab.3 Vaccines are also now available to 28 million US children ages 5 to 11.4 It’s not just a US story. Countries such as South Korea, Canada, Japan, and Italy have inoculated over 75% of their populations.5 For their part, emerging market countries such as Vietnam and Thailand, which as of April of this year had not embarked on an immunization process, have now partially vaccinated over 60% of their populations.5
2. A semblance of normal life is returning
Many Americans are emerging from their homes. Airline travel has returned to near-2019 levels with roughly 1.5 to 2.0 million Americans going through TSA checkpoints each day.6 Restaurant reservations are only 4% below 2019 levels.7 Broadway is back. Stadiums are full.
3. US households are generally in good shape 
US household net worth stands at $142 trillion, an all-time high and up 28% from the depths of the 2020 recession, driven in part by rising equity and home prices.8
4. The US job market is booming
Last Thanksgiving, the unemployment rate stood at 6.9%. Since then, 5.8 million Americans have joined the ranks of the employed. Wages are rising as employers compete to find workers.9 While some may view higher wages as an ominous sign for corporate profitability and future inflation, it’s important to remember that wages as a percent of gross domestic product had previously fallen to its lowest level in the post-WWII period and is still well below the historical average.10 Higher wages tend to drive demand.
5. Business investment is robust
Businesses are flush with cash and are investing at a rapid rate,11 which ultimately will help to rebuild the nation’s supply of goods and potentially improve future productivity.
6. Inflation is elevated, but there may be early signs of supply-chain challenges easing
Higher prices are a concern but there may be initial signs that the worst of the problems could be abating. For example, Chinese exports increased 27.1% last month, as the nation’s exports through October have already surpassed all of 2020.12 Goods such as household appliances, lightings, and furniture saw the fastest export growth in October. In addition, shipping costs (shown below) may be showing signs of having peaked. Further, there are signs that the semiconductor industry could move closer to balance in the coming months, particularly as factories in Asia come back online.

When everyone is celebrating a bull market, it’s no fun to point out the downside that can come from selling investments at a profit. But it’s important for fund investors to understand the potential impact of capital gains distributions — and ways to avoid a hit to their tax bill.
What are capital gains distributions?
When you own an investment — like a stock or a bond — and it goes up in value, that’s a capital gain.
When you sell that investment, you have realized that capital gain, which means you have to pay taxes on it.
That’s a pretty simple concept. But it gets a bit more complicated when you own funds that pay capital gains distributions even though you haven’t sold out of them. With certain types of funds, if a fund manager sells one of their holdings at a profit (without having any losses to offset the gain), then the gains are distributed to the fund shareholders. Simply put, you would have to pay taxes on that gain — even if you don’t sell your fund shares.
How common are capital gains distributions?
In 2020, 57% of US equity mutual funds paid capital gains distributions to their shareholders.1
Over the past 10 years, the average annual distribution from US equity mutual funds ranged from 4% to 8% of the fund’s net asset value.1 Paying taxes on those distributions can erode portfolio returns over time.
Capital gains are generally distributed to fund holders once a year, usually in December.
Is there any way to avoid capital gains distributions?
One way to avoid these distributions is to hold your funds in a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or an IRA.
Another way to potentially reduce the impact is to invest in tax-efficient exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The unique structure of index-based ETFs means that they’re not necessarily required to sell holdings to cover investor outflows (instead, they can use an “in kind” mechanism to create and redeem fund shares). In general, index-based ETFs can potentially distribute gains in rare circumstances, such as dramatically rebalancing a portfolio because of significant changes to its underlying index.
Invesco has 191 ETFs that have not paid any capital gains distributions in the past five years.2 And many, such as Invesco QQQ, Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, and Invesco Taxable Municipal Bond ETF, have never paid capital gains distributions in their lifetime.
Talk to your financial professional and tax advisor about ways to build a portfolio that can reduce the impact of taxes associated with capital gains distributions.

Why investment decision makers at NA pensions voiced a positive outlook for EM in the near term

Ways Institutional Investors are solving for concerns around the quality of information available for decision making

Emerging Markets may be one solution to solve for the search for higher returns during an extended period of low interest rates and low yields on fixed income assets


We believe there is a strong investment case for diversification into emerging market equities as an asset class.  Global growth has primarily been driven by developed economies for the past decade, but emerging economies have increasingly become important growth engines supported by large populations, a growing middle-class, increasing domestic demand, ongoing structural reforms, and productivity gains. Investment opportunities within emerging markets are increasingly driven by unique business models built on strength in areas including domestic consumption, technology, and innovation.  Don’t just take our word for it, hear from your institutional investing peers in our most recent proprietary survey of 150 North American Pension plans.  Investors say they are likely to look beyond conventional strategies in an effort to generate liquidity in the near term and risk-aware returns in the long term.

No one wants to lose money on an investment. But if you do, there’s a potential bright side — your loss may be used to help reduce your tax bill. It’s a process known as tax loss harvesting.
Here’s how it works.
1. Sell for a loss
This step is as simple as it sounds: Sell an underperforming investment — could be an individual stock, a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund — for less than you bought it.
2. Harvest your loss
Here's where losses can potentially help: You can use your losses to offset gains on other investments, helping to reduce your tax obligations. If you have more losses than gains, you can use up to $3,000 to offset the taxes on your ordinary income.
Don't have any gains? That's OK! You can still use losses to offset the taxes on your ordinary income, up to $3,000 in the current year.
Did you lose more than $3,000? You can carry over losses into future tax years in $3,000 increments.
3. Replace your investment
By selling your underperforming investment, you now have cash to invest in something else. The key phrase here is “something else.”
If you sell a security and harvest a tax loss on that sale, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prohibits you from buying a “substantially identical” security within 30 days before or after the sale of your losing investment. (This is called the “wash sale” rule.)
However, that doesn’t mean you have to buy an investment in a completely different industry. For example, if you sold a tech company stock to harvest a tax loss — but you still want tech exposure — you could potentially buy an exchange-traded fund focused on the tech industry. (Just make sure to consult a tax professional first.)


Conclusion
If you’re faced with an underperforming investment, talk to your financial professional and your tax advisor to see if tax loss harvesting is a good idea for you.

Key takeaways
Lifetime income illustrations (LII) are almost here
As early as year-end 2021, many plan sponsors are required to provide LII to participants.
Department of Labor (DOL) provided guidance
Using model language, illustrations and assumptions provides relief from fiduciary liability.
Get prepared
Three key discussion topics can help in advance of LII rollout.

The SECURE Act will soon be requiring Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)-covered defined contribution (DC) plans to include a Lifetime Income Illustration (LII) of the participant account balance expressed as a monthly annuity. The regulation’s goal is to give savers a realistic illustration of how much monthly retirement income they could expect to purchase with their current account balance. The Act also includes corresponding disclosures for participants about the calculation of lifetime income streams and the definition of single and joint life annuities. Plan fiduciaries own the required task of developing and delivering the LII disclosure, but most will choose to partner with their recordkeeper to help satisfy their disclosure requirement.
Here’s a quick rundown of what is required, as well as three key things plan sponsors should consider before the rollout.
WHEN: The timing of the required LII is tricky. For DC plans that provide annual benefit statements the LII is due on the December 31, 2021 annual statement. For DC plans that provide quarterly statements, the LII is due no later than the June 30, 2022 quarterly statement.[1] Check with your recordkeeper on their scheduled rollouts and LII templates.
WHAT: The regulation specifies assumptions to be used for the projections on benefit statements. The required assumptions for the LII calculation include:
‒ Assumed age is 67, or actual if older.
‒ Annuity begins on the last day of the statement period.
‒ Uses current account balance, without projection of future growth.
‒ Displays a single life annuity and a joint life annuity assuming the participant is married.
In return for using the mandated format, assumptions, model language and disclosures provided in the regulation (see example below), plan committees are protected against allegations that the projections are inaccurate or misleading. This relief from liability addresses the concern of plan fiduciaries that participants might sue them if actual monthly payments in retirement fall short of illustrations provided prior to retirement.2

Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
A new variant emerges
The Omicron variant was deemed a COVID “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization.
Markets were rattled by the news
Stocks sold off, oil prices dropped dramatically, and cryptocurrencies sold off as well.
Vaccine research is underway
It will likely take weeks before we know whether Omicron is a major threat, but vaccine developers were optimistic about their ability to quickly alter their vaccine in response.

In my Nov. 1 blog, Nine things to watch this week, I wrote, “I keep hearing that the stock market doesn’t care any more about COVID, that we have moved past it.  That’s a luxury we can have when COVID infections are in abeyance. However, COVID remains a significant market and economic issue…”. The two issues I have remained concerned with is the potential for continued disruption to supply chains, especially in countries with zero tolerance policies towards COVID, and the potential for a “worst case” scenario — the emergence of a COVID variant that is resistant to existing vaccines.  Well, the stock market seemed to once again care about COVID last Friday, when stocks sank globally on news of the emergence of the Omicron variant.  And so it’s time for economists and strategists to once again play arm chair epidemiologists in addition to their day jobs. 
What happened?
A new variant, the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) has emerged.  It was first identified in South Africa but it is not clear where it originated — South Africa was likely the first to detect it simply because it performs a very sophisticated level of genome sequencing relative to many other countries.  Confirmed Omicron cases have been found in a number of places around the world, including Israel, Belgium, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, and Canada. 
Omicron was labeled a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO) last Friday, Nov. 26.  There are two different designations that the WHO gives to variants it wants to follow closely: a “variant of interest” and the more serious “variant of concern.”

A “variant of interest” is a variant with genetic changes that can impact the way the virus is transmitted, its severity, its response to immunity, and/or its response to treatments. In addition, variants of interest have been identified as an emerging risk to global public health — for example, by causing significant community transmission in multiple countries. 
A “variant of concern” meets the definition of a “variant of interest” and is associated with at least one of the following: 1) an increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology, 2) an increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation, 3) a decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, or therapeutics. 

It’s important to note that the omicron variant is not the first variant to receive this more serious label.  Four other variants are also designated “variants of concern” by the World Health Organization: Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.1  There are also two variants that are designated “variants of interest” by the WHO: Lambda and Mu.1
What do we know about Omicron?
Health officials have noted that the Omicron variant is more concerning than the Delta variant because of its unique structure: It has far more spike protein mutations than Delta. The concern is that these mutations could render it both more transmissible and more severe, but it’s not yet clear whether this is the case. 
Maria Van Kerkove of the WHO said Omicron’s large number of mutations “have some worrying characteristics,” but more work needs to be done to assess what this means.2 In the meantime, the World Health Organization warned on Nov. 29 that the global risk from this variant is “very high.”3 While it appears to be very contagious, there is reason to believe it might be a less severe variant, as one initial report suggests that Omicron might result in benign symptoms.  According to Dr. Angelique Coetzee, who chairs the South African Medical Association, she has had a number of patients with the Omicron variant whose symptoms were “different but mild.” However, she is very concerned about the elderly and those who are immune compromised: “What we have to worry about now is that when older, unvaccinated people are infected with the new variant, and if they are not vaccinated, we are going to see many people with a severe [form of the] disease.”4
What has the response been?
Government leaders have responded rapidly to this new variant.  More than 20 nations have imposed travel bans on certain countries.  And the governor of New York State has declared a “state of emergency” because of the rise in COVID-19 infections and the threat of this new variant.
We did hear some good news – that work has already started on understanding the Omicron variant.  Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca have all said they are already testing their respective vaccines against the new variant.   Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they should be able to quickly alter their vaccine so that it can protect against the Omicron variant: “In the event that [a] vaccine-escape variant emerges, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that variant in approximately 100 days, subject to regulatory approval.”5
In addition, some major economies are stepping up vaccination booster deployment, which should help reduce transmission of Delta and other variants, and possibly Omicron if the existing vaccines are effective against it. The UK, for example, moved on Nov. 29 to make available mRNA booster shots for all adults and halve the time lag between a second and third booster shot to three months. There is also some prospect that vaccine reluctance may diminish with the emergence of a potentially more infectious or more virulent variant, as happened in some countries following the emergence of the Delta variant.
Negotiations are in the works for a global pandemic treaty which may someday help avoid some of the international challenges that have hampered vaccine deployment and cross-country coordination of efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Pandemic prevention and management are likely to continue to be major economic issues as urbanization continues across many emerging market countries with high rates of population growth and rapid development.
How have markets reacted? 
Investors panicked on Friday, arguably assuming the worst.  Stocks sold off, with the VIX volatility index surging more than 50%.  Oil prices dropped dramatically, and cryptocurrencies sold off as well.  However, Friday was a thin trading day for stocks (due to the US Thanksgiving holiday) which likely exacerbated the sell-off.  Global stocks have had more mixed results thus far today (Nov. 29), with US and European equities holding up better than Asian equities.
What are the investment implications?
Investors fear a worst-case scenario variant that could send many parts of the world back to the dark days of 2020, with significant lockdowns if existing vaccines don’t protect against this variant and/or it is far more contagious than the Delta variant.  With many major economies now experiencing cold weather, and some European countries already imposing lockdowns before the discovery of this variant, this would only add to problems and exert downward pressure on stocks, especially more cyclically sensitive equities.  In this scenario, we would expect the mid-2020 investing playbook to re-emerge, complete with accommodative monetary policy, real bond yields falling, and growth stocks outperforming value stocks.
What is our outlook on the situation?
We recognize that it will likely take weeks before we will receive enough information on the Omicron variant to know whether it is the major threat that markets seem to fear it is.  We need to hear more from medical experts, especially with regard to whether existing vaccines can effectively protect against it.  Until then, we should be patient and not allow emotions to dictate investing decisions. 
There is certainly the potential for additional market drops and heightened volatility in coming weeks as a result of this variant, especially given all the uncertainty surrounding it, as well as the aggressive stance that many government leaders appear to be taking toward it.  Though we believe markets are unlikely to fall as much as in early 2020, the recent strong gains in cyclical assets suggest that there is room for a decent correction. In our opinion, the biggest negative impact would likely be in assets such as industrial commodities, equities, and real estate. Given that Europe was already in the midst of a new COVID wave and lockdowns, and many of the discoveries of the new variant are in Europe, we suspect European equities could be among the worst performers (with more declines possible, on top of the approximately 4% decline for some major European indices6 seen on Friday).
We believe the most vulnerable sectors are travel and leisure (including hospitality), basic resources, and general retail.  Sectors that may be better protected, in our opinion, include technology, health care and utilities. Among equity factors, we would expect low volatility to perform the best. 
Looking at broader asset categories, we believe that government bonds, gold, investment grade credit and cash may perform the best. Among currencies, it is usually the yen and Swiss franc that have performed the best under these circumstances. 
Having said that, we would again stress that investors not panic.  Recall that last year, those who abandoned stocks when the market fell in March 2020 missed an impressive rebound in the year that followed.  We firmly believe that even if existing vaccines don’t protect against Omicron and it is more transmissible and virulent than other vaccines, it is not a time to panic.  Pharmaceutical companies have expressed confidence that mRNA technology should enable them to re-engineer their vaccines to protect against this variant – so in our view, this does not mean we are going back to the dark days of 2020.
As for our investment outlook, we would maintain current asset allocations, and view any continued sell-offs as a buying opportunity.
We tend to agree with the emerging consensus that the growth impact of the Omicron variant is likely to be less than the growth impact of prior lockdowns and new variants, because of many economies and sectors have learned to cope with social distancing and work from home practices. However, there are likely to be further sector- and firm-level impacts if lockdowns or other targeted restrictions proliferate. 
The inflation impact is ambiguous but probably more skewed toward goods inflation than overall inflation. We anticipate downward pressure on commodity/energy prices would be offset by continuing supply-chain, logistics and labor shortage issues in the production and transport of goods, whose high demand may even be boosted by the spread of Omicron, while services, particularly tourism, leisure and hospitality, may be held back. Goods inflation may also be affected by zero-tolerance policies, lockdowns and travel restrictions in East Asia.
What are the risks to our view?
We are waiting to hear more from medical experts and pharmaceutical companies about the transmissibility and virulence of this variant, as well as the efficacy of vaccines in protecting against Omicron.  If needed, progress on the re-engineering of existing vaccines will need to be followed closely. 
Until then, we will need to follow stringency and mobility data closely, especially given the critically important holiday shopping season.  As was mentioned above, some policymakers have been quick to impose travel bans. For those who are more reluctant to impose lockdowns – ultimately it may be forced upon them if hospitals fill to or beyond capacity.  This would be economically problematic and would likely have a negative impact on the stock market and oil prices.  In this scenario, we would expect the mid-2020 investing playbook to re-emerge, complete with accommodative monetary policy, real bond yields falling, and growth stocks outperforming value stocks.
In the absence of stringency, it is very important to closely follow mobility.  Despite media attention, individuals may choose to continue current levels of shopping and dining out.  For example, this past weekend, 110,000 people attended a football game at the University of Michigan despite the news about the Omicron variant, suggesting that people may be unlikely to stay home unless lockdowns are imposed. 
The greatest risk to our view is that pharmaceutical companies are unable to develop a vaccine to protect against this variant, but that seems unlikely at this juncture.  Even if that were the case, we have developed coping mechanisms that can enable economies to continue to function and avoid the worst of 2020.

Key takeaways
Midstream yields continue to present attractive income opportunities compared to most yield-oriented asset classes
What’s more, many midstream commercial contracts protect the companies’ cash flows (and thus dividend payouts) via fee-escalators linked to inflation indexes.
Third-quarter earnings season began in October
Operating performance has been, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA coming in 1.3% higher than consensus estimates.

Midstream equities performed well in October as third-quarter reporting season kicked off amid a surge of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Despite the equity price recovery from 2020 lows, midstream yields continue to present attractive income opportunities compared to most yield-oriented asset classes while also carrying continued upside potential from recovering global hydrocarbon demand. Further, many midstream commercial contracts protect the companies’ cash flows (and thus dividend payouts) via fee-escalators linked to inflation indexes such as the Producer Price Index or the Consumer Price Index. 
MLP market overview

Midstream MLPs, as measured by the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), ended October up 4.1% on a price basis and up 4.9% after distributions are considered. The AMZ underperformed the S&P 500 Index’s 7.0% total return for the month. The best-performing midstream subsector for October was the Propane group, while the Compression subsector underperformed, on average.
For the year through October, the AMZ is up 36.3% on a price basis, resulting in a 46.0% total return. This compares to the S&P 500 Index’s 22.6% and 24.0% price and total returns, respectively. The Gathering and Processing group has produced the best average total return year-to-date, while the Propane subsector has lagged.
MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-Year US Treasury Bond, narrowed by 37 basis points (bps) over the month, exiting the period at 588 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 696 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 430 bps. The AMZ distribution yield at month-end was 7.4%.
Midstream MLPs and affiliates raised no new marketed equity (common or preferred, excluding at-the-market programs) and issued $3.6 billion of new debt during the month. MLPs and affiliates announced $0.3 billion of new asset acquisitions over the month and four company-level consolidation transactions.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil exited the month at $83.57 per barrel, up 11.4% over the period and 133.5% higher year-over-year. Natural gas prices ended October at $5.43 per million British thermal units (MMbtu), down 7.5% over the month and 61.8% higher than October 2020. Natural gas liquids (NGL) priced at Mont Belvieu exited the month at $48.38 per barrel, 0.6% higher than the end of September and 143.1% higher than the year-ago period.
News

M&A activity picked up. October brought several meaningful M&A transactions. Crestwood Equity Partners (NYSE: CEQP) announced the acquisition of Oasis Midstream Partners (NYSE: OMP) in an equity and cash transaction valued at approximately $1.8 billion including the assumption of debt. Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) and Phillips 66 Partners (NYSE: PSXP) announced an agreement for PSX to acquire all of the publicly held common units of PSXP not already owned by PSX is exchange for PSX shares valued at approximately $3.6 billion. Stonepeak announced the acquisition of Teekay LNG Partners (NYSE: TGP) at an enterprise value of $6.2 billion. Altus Midstream (NYSE: ALTM) and EagleClaw Midstream (Private) announced an agreement to merge, with the EagleClaw management expected to run the new entity. And finally, Rattler Midstream (NYSE: RTLR) announced two acquisitions, a $160 million drop-down transaction of water logistics assets from its sponsor, Diamondback Energy (NYSE: FANG), and a $104 million acquisition of a majority interest in a Midland Basin gas gathering and processing company from West Texas Gas, Inc. and its affiliates through a joint venture.
Third-quarter earnings season kicked off. Third-quarter reporting season began in October. Through month-end, 45 midstream entities had announced distributions for the quarter, including six distribution increases, one reduction, and 38 distributions that were unchanged from the previous quarter. Through the end of October, nine sector participants had reported third-quarter financial results. Operating performance has been, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, coming in 1.3% higher than consensus estimates but 0.2% lower than the preceding quarter.
Chart of the month: Attractive absolute and relative yields

Midstream dividend yields provide an attractive income alternative to other yield-oriented products. The AMZ distribution yield at month-end was 7.4%, and MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-Year US Treasury Bond, exited October at 588 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 696 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 430 bps. The AMZ’s 7.4% yield is significantly higher than yields for other income-oriented equities, such as REITs and utilities, as well as corporate bonds, including high yield.

Brian Levitt
Global Market Strategist


Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled in testimony to Congress that the Fed is likely to accelerate the tapering of asset purchases in December. The messaging came as some surprise to the market as concerns over the Omicron variant are rife. Investors had grown used to the Fed managing the downside risks to the economy in what had been a structurally weak inflationary environment. We would, however, expect the Fed to back off its more hawkish posture if the Omicron variant proves to be a persistent challenge to the global economy. Markets immediately responded to the prospect of tighter-than-expected policy — the US Treasury yield curve flattened,1 oil prices fell,2 and cyclical sectors such as energy, materials, industrials, and financials led the US equity market lower following the Nov. 30 testimony.3
Here’s five thoughts on the likely prospect of accelerated tapering and the market’s reaction:
1)      Market volatility and drawdowns generally don’t emerge out of nowhere. They tend to be the result of policy uncertainty and/or unexpected changes in policy. While it had been widely expected that the Fed would begin to taper asset purchases, it comes as a surprise for the Fed to accelerate the timeline to end quantitative easing with the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant and its potential impact to the global economy so prevalent.
2)      The fear of a hawkish policy mistake was prevalent in the bond market on Tuesday. A prevailing narrative among investors had been that bond yields would rise as the Fed provided less support to the US Treasury market, as was the case during the 2013 “taper tantrum.” The opposite happened on Tuesday as long bond yields plummeted amid concerns that the Fed was proceeding toward tighter policy at a potentially inopportune time. Importantly, financial conditions, which tightened modestly over the past week, remain historically easy and well below levels reached during the 2013 taper tantrum and the 2015 Fed rate hike.      
3)      The market, as represented by the fed funds rate, is pricing in two interest rate hikes in 2022.4 In our opinion, it is too soon to extrapolate future rate hikes given the uncertainty of the Omicron variant.  The Fed backed off its tighter policy stance multiple times over the prior cycle, and we would expect them to do the same should economic and employment conditions deteriorate.   
4)      Typically, it’s not the first interest rate hike that matters. Rather, it’s the last interest rate hike that tends to be of greater importance. A review of past initial rate hikes in business cycles (’94, ‘04, ’15) indicates that equity returns were robust in the 12 months prior to, and 36 months post, the first interest rate hike, weakening only when there was a meaningful bear flattening of the US Treasury yield curve.5  The US Treasury yield curve has flattened in recent days but is relatively steep compared to periods that presaged recessions. 
5)      Our expectation has been for the economy to moderate from a robust expansion toward a more sustainable rate of growth. Admittedly, we did not expect the combined catalyst of the Omicron variant and a more hawkish Fed to be fast tracking the markets to our views. As the economy slows, we would expect market leadership to shift from the so-called recovery and reflation trades toward longer duration assets and structural growth businesses.

Key takeaways
2020 and 2021 saw dramatic monetary and fiscal policy moves
2022 looks to be a year of transition as policies and economies move toward a more normal state.
Inflation will likely define the economic and market environment next year
Continued supply-chain disruptions and an upsurge in demand are threatening to keep inflation high across many economies.
Our base case foresees normalizing global growth, remaining above its long-term trend but decelerating to a more sustainable rate
We also share tail risk scenarios for transitory and persistent inflation risk, and the investment implications of each.

It’s that time of year again, when we release our Investment Outlook for the coming year. As always, this has been a collaborative effort, reflecting the views of many investment professionals and thought leaders at Invesco. We have provided a base case scenario, which we believe is very likely, along with the potential investment implications of that scenario. In addition, we have once again provided two tail risk scenarios, which we believe are less likely but nevertheless important to contemplate. We also explore the potential investment implications of those tail risk scenarios.
Setting the stage

2020 and 2021 saw dramatic monetary and fiscal policy moves. Now the stage is set for 2022 to be a year of transition as policies and economies move toward a more normal state. However, issues remain that will likely define the economic and market environment, including continued supply-chain disruptions and an upsurge in demand that threaten to keep inflation high across many economies. For 2022, our outlook is centered on the question of inflation and how markets and policymakers may react to it.

Our base case

We expect global growth to normalize, remaining above its long-term trend but decelerating to a more sustainable rate as fiscal stimulus is gradually removed. We anticipate that inflation will peak in mid-2022 and then start to slowly moderate, backing down toward target rates by the end of 2023 as supply-chain issues resolve, vaccination levels increase, and more employees return to the workforce. We still believe the Federal Reserve (Fed) will be patiently accommodative, with a rate lift-off in the back half of 2022, although other developed countries’ central banks might act more quickly. Finally, we expect volatility will increase as markets digest the transition to slower growth and a gradual tightening in monetary policy.

From a relative asset allocation perspective, our base case expectations lead us to a reduced risk posture, with a slight overweighting of equities tilted toward defensive sectors such as information technology, communication services, health care, real estate and consumer staples. We prefer quality and large caps in this scenario, given slowing growth expectations and stable (or lower) long-term bond yields. We also anticipate that alternatives such as real estate and private credit, as well as commodities, would outperform in this environment. For regional allocations, our base case indicates a preference for emerging markets (including EM currencies) due to cyclical divergence and US equities over other developed markets as the global slowdown favors regions with lower cyclical exposure and lower operating leverage.

Transitory inflation risk

In our transitory inflation risk scenario, current inflation fears prove to be overblown, with inflation gradually coming off its current highs toward something close to or below 2%. We see higher than normal growth in this environment, ultimately pointing to economies being earlier in the cycle than we currently judge them. In this scenario, our favored asset classes would include equities (particularly industrials, materials, energy, and financials) as well as high yield and investment grade fixed income; regionally we would prefer the US (and the US dollar) and developed ex-US markets.

Persistent inflationary risk

In our persistent inflationary risk scenario, developed central banks’ messaging fails to convince markets that inflation is transitory, with further elevated prints throughout 2022. We see the problem as stemming from a combination of elevated demand driven by past monetary expansion and supply-side disruptions. This causes inflation expectations to become unanchored, with medium-term expectations rising above the 4% mark persistently. This would signal a loss of credibility for those central banks, requiring action that prompts a significant risk of ending the current economic cycle. In this downside scenario, we would look for gold, ex-US developed market sovereigns (hedged), and inflation-protected bonds to outperform. Within equities we would prefer defensives, communications, large caps, and quality issuers. Regionally we would favor Australia, Canada, and Japan.

The path ahead

We recognize that we have formed these views largely prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant and the possibility of an accelerated taper timeline from the Fed. These events at present do not alter our views in a meaningful way. Indeed, the potential for an earlier move from the Fed is a marginal event, and the Omicron variant introduces uncertainty but has not yielded a Draconian shutdown in economic activity. Omicron may prolong the recovery in tourism and some services sectors, but we do not foresee a return to harsh early-pandemic measures to manage the virus. As we have said so many times throughout this pandemic, the risks are elevated but we remain optimistic about the path forward.

Key takeaways
All eyes on COP26
The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) is a pivotal moment where countries discuss their commitments to live up to the Paris Agreement.
Biden’s climate roadmap
Biden’s “Roadmap to Build an Economy Resilient to Climate Change Impacts” includes six key pillars.
A list of initiatives
Achieving these objectives will require a myriad of initiatives that include executive orders, regulations, and legislation.

As world leaders, congressional members, global corporate executives, environmental activists, and climate-impacted communities convened in Glasgow, Scotland, for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (Conference of the Parties or COP26), the pressure was on the United States and President Joe Biden to deliver not just remarks but durable energy and environmental policy that sets the planet on the right path. COP26 runs Oct. 31 through Nov. 12, but the work prior to the conference might be more important than what actually transpires in Glasgow. Washington has dedicated more than $555 billion in the reconciliation or Build Back Better (BBB) package to climate initiatives. This includes a cross section of policies with investments in buildings, transportation, manufacturing, electricity, and agriculture. The climate component is the largest component of the Democrats’ BBB plan, and the president plans to use that as part of his leverage at COP26 to compel other countries to take aggressive measures to clean up the environment.
It is in that context that Biden and his administration are in the hot seat. COP26 is a pivotal moment where countries gather to discuss their commitments to live up to the Paris Agreement (COP21). The Paris Agreement called for every country to work collectively to limit global warming to “well below” two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels (with a preference of 1.5 degrees) and instructed them to return every five years to discuss the steps they had initiated. There is pressure building from many countries at COP26 to set a new objective for larger emitting countries to commit to a 1.5 degrees Celsius target but that policy remains fluid. In order to demonstrate that the United States can be counted on for its climate commitment — and that the rest of the world should follow — Biden needs to show he is delivering tangible policy that can meet those temperature goals.
What did the president and his team have in hand to demonstrate to world leaders that the United States is once again the environmental beacon? Like no previous presidential candidate, Biden campaigned on addressing climate change head on. It was not a campaign slogan, a bumper sticker, a wedge issue, or a way to differentiate from President Donald Trump — it was a defining policy pillar that he, and the Democratic Party, saw as imperative to not only win the election but to reorient the United States as a world leader. Biden viewed rejoining the Paris Agreement as a way to restore international faith in the United States, transform the economy, help other countries address their clean energy needs, and incubate millions of clean energy jobs at home and abroad. His pledge to reduce emissions by 50% to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030 transcended all previous administration policies.
The six pillars of Biden’s climate roadmap
Those campaign promises have started to come to fruition with a “whole-of-government” approach to mitigating climate change. Biden’s “Roadmap to Build an Economy Resilient to Climate Change Impacts,” released on Oct. 15, includes six key pillars: 

Promoting the resilience of the US financial system to climate-related financial risk.
Protecting Americans’ life savings and pensions from climate-related financial risk.
Using federal procurement to address climate-related financial risk.
Incorporating climate-related financial risk into federal financial management and budgeting.
Incorporating climate-related financial risk into federal lending and underwriting.
Building resilient infrastructure and communities.

Achieving these objectives will require a myriad of initiatives that include executive orders, regulations, and legislation.

Regulations and executive orders. One of the more powerful tools the Biden administration has in its arsenal to address climate change is executive actions. They have and will continue to use the regulatory process to strengthen existing environmental and energy regulations that can help address emissions. Some steps that have been initiated include:


Mandating the end of production of hydrofluorocarbons
 Restoring and tightening auto emissions standards
 Strengthening and further utilizing the Clean Air Act to regulate power plant emissions
 Regulating methane leaks from new and existing oil and gas pipelines (announced at COP26)
 Tightening mercury emissions from utility coal plants


Procurement. The Biden administration’s Office of Management and Budget is looking to amend its procurement policy to require agencies to consider a supplier’s greenhouse gas emissions when making purchasing decisions. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council will consider providing preferences for bidders with lower greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is the world’s largest purchaser of goods and services with over $650 billion in annual contracts. By taking such steps to consider emissions of bidding contractors, the hope is this would drive cleaner energy and environmental business decisions.
Appropriations. As part of the Paris Agreement, major economies were expected to help finance nearly $100 billion in the annual United Nations’ Green Climate Fund, which provides funding for developing countries to mitigate climate impacts and transition to clean energy generation. Biden originally committed $2.5 billion but increased that pledge to $5.7 billion annually, and he offered to double that amount by 2024. The Senate’s State, Foreign Operations and Related Agencies spending bill contains $1.45 billion. However, with the federal government operating on a continuing resolution, which simply continues government funding under the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year, the president’s commitment will remain a pledge at COP26 and will fall short on actual dollars committed to the Green Climate Fund. In addition to the international climate funds, the FY 2022 Senate spending packages include several pots of funds to help the president meet his climate objectives, including spending on environmental justice and the Civilian Climate Corps (a green jobs training program). However, both programs face opposition from Republicans who say these policies are masking as the Green New Deal. As the end of the year quickly approaches, it is increasingly likely that government funding will operate on a continuing resolution throughout 2022.
IIJA and reconciliation. The Democrat-controlled Congress has packed environmental and energy policies into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA, also known as the “hard infrastructure” bill) and the BBB reconciliation package, not to mention the Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations bills – all of which await final approval. The Clean Electricity Performance Plan (CEPP), the cornerstone of Biden’s climate policy, was set to kick things into high gear by helping the country achieve zero-carbon power by 2035, but was jettisoned from the package based on opposition from the Senate. The CEPP offered incentives and/or grants to utilities to transition to cleaner generation while penalizing those that did not. Utilities would have received grants for those that increased their clean energy transition by at least 4%. Eliminating the CEPP was a major setback to the president’s climate objective as it was expected to secure a majority of the country’s emissions reductions. The $150 billion CEPP program fund was transferred to other clean energy policy initiatives like the Production Tax Credit (PTC), Investment Tax Credit (ITC), energy transmission, and storage programs within the BBB. There is support for policies that stimulate investment in transmission lines to accommodate new solar and wind farms. This will likely include support for rural co-op utilities to stimulate energy efficiency and generation.
Tax provisions. The BBB framework includes policies to transition the country to cleaner energy generation and utilization totaling $320 billion in incentives. The compromise being negotiated between the House and Senate will follow the path of the Ways and Means Committee to continue energy credits for five years and then transition to a technology neutral approach favored by the Finance Committee. Specifically, this will include incentives like extensions and expansions to the PTC and ITC. In addition, the final package will likely include green fleet transportation transition funds, green aviation fuel incentives, green or clean hydrogen incentives, battery technology, home energy, rooftop solar, as well energy efficiencies and storage credits.

Other potential items:

Electric vehicles (EVs). Supplies $13.5 billion in charging infrastructure as well as manufacturing incentives for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and their supply chains. Credits will be focused on OEMs and their customers who purchase vehicles with union-made or prevailing-wage labor forces, domestic supply chains, and battery components produced in the United States. The credit for an EV purchase could total $12,500 for a middle-class family.
Grants and loans. Offered to support various industrial sector decarbonization initiatives. Expand loan guarantees for clean energy technologies and establish a program to compensate industries that reduce emissions.
Public transit systems and infrastructure. Increased funding to mass transit to increase efficiencies, capacity, and the electrification of the systems. There will be funds for port electrification and fleets.
Methane. The proposal is to ramp up the per-ton fee for a methane leak to $900 in 2023, $1,200 in 2024, and $1,500 in 2025 to encourage fossil energy companies to control powerful gas emissions. This would apply to both onshore and offshore facilities. The proposal is heavily opposed by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Chamber of Commerce and could see changes as the framework is flushed out.
State and local efforts. The Biden administration will look for not only federal leadership on climate policies but will support state and local policies to help drive the United States’ commitment to reducing emissions. Within the BBB plan, Congress plans to provide tens of billions in financing initiatives to deploy zero emissions technologies.

Another area where the Biden administration is flexing its climate muscles is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Although FERC is an independent agency, it is seen as a pivotal force in addressing climate change at the federal level. FERC is the key regulatory agency that oversees interstate transmission of natural gas, oil, pipelines, and hydro projects, as well as their respective permits. FERC has reoriented some of its decision-making to ensure that project approvals address climate and environmental justice costs.
Further evidence of this government-wide approach to climate policy is the president’s own attendance at COP26 and those who joined him:

Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry
National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy
Secretary of State Tony Blinken
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan
Interior Secretary Deb Haaland
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack
USAID Administrator Samantha Power
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Administrator Rick Spinrad
·White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Eric Lander
National Economic Council Director Brian Deese

Conclusion
COP26 is a transcendent moment for the president, Democrats in Congress, and the world as attendees and witnesses look to the United States for clear and definitive action. The trip is a signal of whether the promises Biden campaigned on and his efforts in the first 10 months in office are enough of a North Star to restore confidence that every country is in this climate battle collectively. US leadership, albeit not as ambitious as originally imagined, seems to remain intact for now.

It has become a familiar refrain in recent years that Congress cannot get to the end of a legislative session without some form of crisis – whether driven by politics, policy, or both – and there are always one or two big items that need to get passed before everyone heads home for the holidays.
This year, though, seems especially fraught with crises both fiscal and political, and both between and within each of the parties. Given that Democrats have only a three-vote margin in the House and a vice presidential tiebreaker in the Senate, there is little room for error as they navigate funding the government, avoiding default on US debt, passing a $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework (BIF), and a $3.5 trillion-dollar domestic spending bill, commonly referred to as “reconciliation” or Build Back Better (BBB). Oh, and there’s the routine stuff like passing the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Suffice to say there’s plenty to do, not much time to do it, and more than enough political risk to go around.
Crisis #1 – government funding
Congress passed a continuing resolution (or CR) to keep the government running through Dec. 3. While this averted the possibility of a government shutdown in October, it also just kicked the can down the road a couple of months, setting up another fight over government spending right around Thanksgiving. The endgame for Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations remains decidedly unclear. The House has passed nine of the 12 annual appropriations bills while the Senate has passed none. This suggests there will be some sort of omnibus legislation containing all the bills, multiple smaller versions that combine a few appropriations bills, or even just a straight CR that would keep funding levels flat through the end of the year if the parties can’t agree on funding levels for each agency. More to come over the next two months as Congress inches toward yet another potential shutdown.
Crisis #2 – government default
Much like the continuing resolution, Congress has kicked the debt ceiling can down the road, at least until Dec. 3. However, unlike the spending bill, it may be very difficult to get a reprieve like this again. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) has made clear that Republicans in the Senate will not help Democrats raise the debt ceiling in December, insisting that they use “reconciliation” to increase the debt limit. McConnell suggested that he agreed to a short extension to give Democrats time to include a longer-term increase in the reconciliation bill, undercutting the chief Democratic argument that there was not time to include the debt ceiling in that process. Democrats are continuing to say they will not use the reconciliation process to deal with the debt issue. They insist that Republicans support the debt increase because it is paying for obligations incurred under previous Democrat and Republican presidents — and because they supported an increase three times while President Donald Trump was in office. Like the spending bill, this will come to a head around Thanksgiving when Congress will have to do this all over again to avert both a government shutdown and a default on its debt.
Crisis #3 – intraparty feud
This crisis doesn’t have the immediate real-world impact that either a government shutdown or debt default would have, but the debate between moderate and progressive Democrats over the $1.2 trillion BIF and the $3.5 trillion BBB plan that contains much of President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda is something of an existential crisis for both the administration and the Democratic majority in Congress.
The Senate passed the BIF by a vote of 69-30. That sent it to the House, where progressive Democrats immediately demanded that it be linked to the larger BBB package and threatened to withhold their votes if they did not get a commitment from the Senate to move the BBB. Moderate Democrats, not to be outdone, said they would not vote for the BBB if they did not first get a vote on BIF. Speaker Nancy Pelosi navigated this by promising the moderates a vote on BIF on Sept. 27 and promising the progressives that the reconciliation bill would be voted on shortly thereafter.
Moderate Senate Democrats, however, have other ideas – enter Senator Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) and Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Arizona). Neither of them will support a $3.5 trillion package, with Manchin suggesting that $1.5 trillion is his ceiling and that the Senate “pause” in its consideration of the larger bill. Sinema has not said what size package she would support, but also has not supported Manchin’s calls for delay. Biden made his first in-person visit to House Democrats on Oct. 1 and suggested that the price tag for BBB could be in the range of $1.9 trillion to $2.3 trillion. He also blew up the timing for a vote on BIF, saying votes could happen “six minutes, six days, or six weeks from now.”
Neither of these bills needs to be passed to avoid some sort of fiscal calamity, but both need to be passed for Democrats to show they can govern, that Biden can deliver on his promises, and that congressional Democrats should be rewarded by retaining their majority in the next Congress.
Crisis #4 – well, not really a crisis but certainly important
Every year for the last 60 years, Congress has passed and the president has signed the annual NDAA. Because neither Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) nor House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith (D-Washington) want to be the first to break that streak, the odds are high that it will pass again this fall. So the real question is, when? The House adopted its version on Sept. 23 by a vote of 316-113. The Senate has reported its version from committee, but when it will reach the Senate floor is an open question. Given the logjam of major bills ahead of it, the Senate may not take this up until late in the fall.
There’s plenty to do to keep Congress busy for the next few months with enough political twists and turns to be entertaining, but also potentially calamitous. Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.

As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden campaigned on long-sought but unfulfilled cornerstones of the Democratic Party – climate change, health care reforms, child and elder care, and a more progressive tax code that would ensure the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. Promises of his Build Back Better plan helped propel candidate Biden to the White House and helped align him with the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party. His campaign promises helped Democrats maintain their majority in the House of Representatives and take control of the Senate, albeit by a slim margin, giving the party a real opportunity to deliver generational changes via the budget reconciliation process.
The idea of utilizing reconciliation sounds easy in concept—pass legislation delivered through streamlined and expeditious Senate and House processes—but in reality, with razor-thin majorities for Democrats in both chambers, it’s become no leisurely Sunday drive. Complicating matters is the dual-track process of trying to pass a once-in-a-lifetime infrastructure package along with trillions of dollars in social safety net programs.
On June 24, the president, along with a group of bipartisan senators, announced a bold “hard infrastructure” framework that eventually led to Senate passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) less than two months later. IIJA passed with a vote of 69-30 and attracted the support of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). At that juncture, the expectation was that the House would move forward and deliver a huge win for Biden and the country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California), however, had a different idea. She quickly responded to the Senate’s efforts to advance infrastructure legislation by saying, “There ain’t going to be no bipartisan bill (IIJA), unless we have a reconciliation bill.” The fate of both pieces of legislation—the IIJA and the American Family Plan (AFP)/Build Back Better—are now married, putting the House behind the wheel but with two moderate senators in the passenger seat navigating the road.
With a three-seat majority, Pelosi is in a precarious situation as she tries to advance both IIJA and AFP to the president’s desk. With a raucous and emboldened progressive wing of her party demanding that the AFP advance via reconciliation before they consider voting “yes” on IIJA, the vote on the president’s hard infrastructure bill appears to be on the backburner for several weeks. Meanwhile, a smaller but equally brash group of House moderates appears far more attached to and supportive of IIJA. They are showing reluctance to support many of the key elements of the AFP, with particular discomfort around the pay-for elements and health care policies—individual and corporate tax increases, changes to energy tax provisions, and Medicare and Medicaid changes. This has yielded some severe consternation from their progressive colleagues who view those policy changes as critical deliverables to their constituents. That political rub is the Rubik’s Cube that both Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) are trying to solve.
Complicating Schumer’s path forward in his 50-50 Senate are Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-Arizona) and Senator Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia)—without their buy-in on the policies or price tag, the Senate is paralyzed on moving forward with the reconciliation package. When the 117th Congress kicked-off, more progressive Senate Democrats were calling for over $6 trillion in spending to enhance society’s safety net with investments in climate change, child and elder care, affordable prescription drugs, and a redistribution of wealth of a magnitude not seen in generations. When that $6 trillion appeared on shaky political ground during the legislative process, they sought to downsize those asks to roughly $3.5 trillion. That price tag, however, does not appear within the realm of possibility for Sinema and Manchin and other moderate Democrats. As the process has played out, Manchin has articulated that his comfort zone is around $1.5 trillion. Whatever the number, Schumer and his peers will need to work hard to find out what’s palatable not only to his more moderate members, but also to others on the political spectrum of his caucus. Democrats will need to decide if they want to scale down the programs within the reconciliation package to fit within the final price tag of the legislation or concentrate the spending to a few critical programs.
All of this is occurring while Republicans are enjoying the intraparty squabbling of their Democratic peers. The longer this process plays out, real questions are starting to emerge about what the president can deliver, and Republicans are relishing the stagnation of the legislative process. Senate Republicans are on record supporting IIJA, and there are likely a dozen or so House Republicans that would vote for it too. Yet, zero Republicans support passage of AFP (the Build Back Better platform) via the reconciliation process, citing opposition not only to many of the policies, but also to the increase in taxes that are being contemplated to pay for these programs. In addition, there is spending fatigue in Washington as trillions have been spent to counter the COVID pandemic going back to the Trump administration. As the process plays out and the 2022 midterm elections get closer and closer, Republicans’ desire to help pass cornerstone legislation will likely continue to evaporate much like the summer’s humidity.
Adding further fuel to Biden’s and congressional Democrats’ desire to pass both IIJA and AFP/reconciliation is the upcoming COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, in early November. Biden needs to demonstrate the United States’ leadership in addressing climate change with transformative energy policy. Without passage of the reconciliation package, he will have less leverage to push his fellow world leaders to take action on clean energy initiatives. This will likely fuel Democrats’ drive to find a compromise to help their president deliver on global clean energy objectives. 
While the 117th Congress has seen its share of ups and down and starts and stops, there is too much on the line for the majority party to let the IIJA and AFP/reconciliation die on the vine. Look for Biden and congressional Democrats to find a way to deliver on their promises by focusing the country’s attention not on the price tag of the legislation, but the policies within. The final reconciliation package’s size and scope will likely be far less than what progressives want, and given the tensions in the party, it may not come together until the very end of the year.

The jousting between the US and China has spilled into the financial markets as both countries look to rein in technology companies for both national security and domestic policy reasons. Policymakers in the US have become concerned that China is using access to US capital markets and technology to improve its military and security apparatus. The policy response has taken the form of an executive order, issued by former President Donald Trump and amended by President Joe Biden, to bar Americans from investing in firms owned or controlled by the Chinese military, and to put Chinese companies on the US “entities list” to bar export of certain “dual use” technologies to those firms. Congress also stepped up and passed a law in late 2020 that would delist a foreign company after three consecutive years of non-compliance with Public Company Accountability Oversight Board (PCAOB) audit inspections. The regulatory process to implement this new statute is underway with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who warned in August that “the clock is ticking.”
The Biden administration, in amending the original executive order, listed 59 Chinese companies with ties to China’s military or its surveillance industry. The amendments made by Biden clarified that subsidiaries of listed companies would be subject to the investment ban only if they were designated as subject entities by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). The changes were made after two Chinese companies successfully challenged the original order in court.

This summer, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee approved a new “anti-foreign sanctions law” providing the government with sweeping new powers to seize assets and block business transactions. The law is aimed at “any individual or organization that is directly or indirectly involved in the formulation, decision or implementation of foreign sanctions.” Specifically, the government in Beijing is empowered to refuse visas, ban entry, invalidate visas, and deport foreigners. In addition, the government may now seize or freeze assets and prohibit transactions with Chinese companies or individuals. Lastly, it also allows Chinese nationals to file lawsuits against individuals who implement “discriminatory restrictive measures.”
The Chinese have also moved to limit their companies’ access to foreign capital. The Chinese Cyberspace Administration has proposed new rules that limit Chinese companies that possess data of more than 1 million people from conducting an initial public offering (IPO) abroad until they have undergone a cybersecurity review. This move is viewed just as much as an attempt to rein in technology companies that Beijing fears could become a source of competition for power with the ruling party as it is an effort to limit the influence of US and other foreign investors.
What comes next?
This summer, as investors priced in the news of increased scrutiny from Beijing, share values of Chinese companies plummeted. Almost three quarters of Chinese companies listed on foreign exchanges were trading below their IPO price. For example, share prices for Didi, the ride-hailing company, dropped almost 40%1 and shareholders sued the company after it failed to disclose that it was in talks with the government over failure to comply with China’s cybersecurity laws. Some companies that were planning IPOs in foreign markets have decided to delay them, like Link Doc Technology, a health care firm; and Ximalaya, an audio-sharing platform. Others have decided to move their business to Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, Congress continues to look for creative ways to limit Chinese company access to US capital markets. Efforts continue in both the US House and US Senate to prevent the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, the manager of the US government’s 401k plan, from investing in Chinese companies. The House continues its work on China-related legislation in response to the Senate-passed United States Innovation and Competition Act last spring. The Senate will also turn to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022, which will carry some China-related provisions. To summarize, look for more action on China policy in the Congress over the balance of the year.
Congress isn’t the only actor to watch over the next few months. The executive branch has been busy too. United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai had a call with her Chinese counterpart Vice Premier Liu He on Oct. 8 where they reviewed implementation of the US-China Economic and Trade Agreement and agreed to further consultations on outstanding issues. Two days before that, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with Chinese Communist Party Politburo Member and Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission Yang Jiechi in Switzerland as follow-up to a phone call between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping the previous month. The Switzerland meeting produced an “agreement in principle” for the two leaders to hold a “virtual” meeting before the end of the year. This flurry of activity indicates that both sides at least agree on the need for open lines of communication. Whether or not communication results in progress on the relationship remains to be seen.

Even the Democratic party faithful acknowledge that the Biden honeymoon is over. And as they head into the 2022 midterms, that fact is making party leaders nervous.
What was a promising start with the US leading the world in the COVID vaccine rollout was followed by a sputtering of vaccination rates, most notably in states and districts that former President Donald Trump carried in the 2020 election, followed by the Delta variant wave and the disastrous pullout of American troops from Afghanistan. Pundits are pointing at independent voters that helped to elect Biden as those largely responsible for the president’s tanking numbers.
In sum, Joe Biden needs a win. Badly.
As we enter yet another election season with the razor-thin three-seat Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, and Vice President Kamala Harris acting as a tie breaker in the Senate, Democrats have very little margin for error. Causing further headache for the president is the ongoing battle between moderate and progressive Democrats. Polling suggests that the current legislative debate related to the bipartisan infrastructure legislation and the so-called Build Back Better reconciliation package is not to blame for Biden’s dismal numbers, but passage of either or both could help boost the president’s standing and allow him to take a victory lap.
And a boost he needs. According to recent poll numbers, Americans are losing trust and confidence in Biden’s handling of the Delta variant. Fewer than half (45%) now trust Biden to provide accurate information about the coronavirus, down significantly from when he took office in January (58%). Compared to the January high point, Biden has lost trust relatively evenly across the board among Democrats (an 11-percentage-point decline to 81%) and Republicans (a 10-point decline to 11%). Perhaps more concerning for the Biden faithful is that the president has experienced his largest decline among Independents – down 17 points to 42%. The number who trust the federal government to relay accurate information has also declined to just under half (49%), compared to 54% two weeks ago.1
But despite that decline, a majority of Americans support many of the policies the president has put in place, like vaccine mandates for federal employees. Newly announced vaccine requirements for federal employees, and businesses with 100 employees or more, are backed by a majority of Americans. However, this majority support conceals deep divisions along partisan fault lines. Overall, 60% of Americans support the federal government implementing these two rules. There is a similar level of support among employed Americans for their own employer to require vaccines in the workplace (57%). For both of these new requirements, more than eight in ten Democrats support them, and so do about 60% of Independents. However, only an estimated 30% of Republicans back these requirements.2
Republican leaders’ poll numbers on handling of the pandemic are also in decline, and Americans still trust Democrats over Republicans on COVID. Americans believe, by a 16-point margin3, that they are better off with Biden in charge of the pandemic than they would have been with the alternative: Donald Trump.
According to a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll, just 30% of US adults think the coronavirus situation would be better if Trump were still president. Far more — 46% — say it would be worse. Notably, the share of 2020 Biden voters who say things would be worse with Trump in charge (88%) is nearly 20 points higher than the share of Trump voters who say things would be better (69%), suggesting that even some of the former president’s fans are not confident he would have handled Delta well.
The best news for Biden and congressional Democrats is that they find themselves in October of 2021, not October of 2022. They have a year to put points on the board and reverse these daunting and historic odds as the pandemic, and the politics surrounding it, rages on.

Despite a volatile market tone in November, returns across the investment-grade bond market were generally flat during the month. A rise in short-term rates was offset by a decline in longer-term rates as investors grappled with a new variant, persistent inflation, and a Federal Reserve that is pulling back from crisis-era stimulus in a meaningful way. This “flattening” of the yield curve, where short-term rates rise and long-term rates hold steady or fall, began in October and is yet another reflection of the havoc the emergence from the pandemic is having on the economy, and in turn, the bond market.

Key takeaways
Data has become more important than ever to health care research and management
Health care data is helping to evolve the ways we measure, detect, and prevent disease.
Technology is also ushering in changes in disease management
By allowing health care providers and manufacturers to track compliance with treatment protocols, technology is enabling a coordinated carrot-and-stick approach to population health.

Health care digitalization: We’ve known for a long time that it’s coming. Hollywood has trained us to expect a dystopian existence, complete with beeping microchips and expressionless faces, once we start datamining our bodies. But the reality is much more humane and is already quietly underway. From disease measurement to detection to all-out prevention, data has become more important than ever to health care research and management.

More precise measurement

First, the low-hanging fruit: measurement. How many health problems could be solved simply by measuring things more precisely via a sort of Internet of Bodily Things? As the management guru Peter Drucker asserts, “What gets measured, gets managed.”1

Consider diabetes. Not long ago, it was a death sentence if a body couldn’t regulate its blood sugar. Even today, diabetes shaves off about eight years of life expectancy.2 Artificial insulin (which mops up excess blood sugar) ranks high on the list of scientific miracles, but its usage has been more art than science — draw blood to test its sugar content, inject some insulin based on an estimate of meals and activities, and brace for an emergency in case that estimate is wrong. Indeed, many parents of children with Type 1 diabetes wake up every two to three hours each night to verify that their children haven’t slipped into a coma from a miscalculated dose of insulin. Now, companies like Medtronic are revolutionizing the treatment of diabetes with systems that continually monitor blood sugar levels and automatically pump in just the right amount of insulin. Sensors and data technology are sweeping in changes we couldn’t have imagined a generation ago.
Faster detection
Data is also moving medical diagnosis to earlier in a disease’s life cycle. Instead of waiting until someone finds a lump, cancer doctors may soon receive telltale signs that a tumor is coming down the pike, while there’s still time to do something about it. Early screening isn’t a new idea; the mortality rate for cervical cancer, once the leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States, plummeted by 70% between 1955 and 1992.3 We believe this can be attributed to the rise of a simple annual ritual: the Pap smear test.

But studying tissue samples as a routine screen is highly impractical for most bodily organs, which is why “liquid biopsies” could be game-changing. These tests examine blood samples for “biomarker” DNA clues that a budding cancer strews in its wake. We think companies like Illumina and Guardant Health are poised to usher in an age where the frequent interrogation of our bodies will expose cancers early.4

Disease prevention

More intriguingly, we think data may even help prevent disease altogether. Genomics is buzzing here — everything from sequencing to CRISPR (a gene editing technology) to consumer genetic profiling — and companies seem to be inexorably leading us to a world where at least some orphan diseases may be nipped in the bud before they progress meaningfully.

However, we believe that the most powerful punch may come from simply persuading people to adopt more healthful behaviors. While history shows past attempts at disease management haven’t always proven effective,5 technology is ushering in change.
For example, the medical devices company ResMed has begun collecting data from the masks and air generators it supplies to sleep apnea patients. Sleep apnea is correlated with many severe conditions such as strokes and heart disease, and some doctors believe we can mitigate these outcomes with better sleep apnea management. Armed with data, today’s doctors can see exactly how their patients fare each night. Compliance rates for sleep apnea mask usage have shot up to 87% from 60% historically,6 partly because doctors can identify issues with precision, and partly because many payors now won’t pay for treatment unless they see that patients are following treatment protocol. Technology is enabling the kind of coordinated carrot-and-stick approach to population health that has historically been a pipe dream in our siloed healthcare systems.
Conclusion
Luck, someone famously said, is when preparation meets opportunity. At the Invesco Oppenheimer International Growth Fund, we seek to create our own luck through years of painstakingly meeting companies and researching markets. When opportunity strikes, we are ready to pounce, and we believe that opportunity abounds in the field of heath care data and research.

Key takeaways
Digital assets are now a major asset class
Representing more than $2 trillion in market capitalization, digital assets are an important, emerging asset class.
There's more to digital assets than meets the eye
Digital assets comprise more than just blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
Investors may want to consider digital assets
The companies, technologies and financial instruments involved in bringing digital assets to life present broad investment opportunities.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin) aren’t just disruptive forces that are transforming the way people, businesses and governments transact and share information. These digital assets have become a major asset class for investors looking for potential returns and diversification. The cryptocurrency market alone comprises more than 11,000 cryptocurrencies representing over $2 trillion in market capitalization.1
If you think that cryptocurrency and blockchain are the only digital assets worth knowing as an investor, you’re missing out on the full picture. Digital assets encompass more than just cryptocurrency and blockchain; the ecosystem also includes companies that mine cryptocurrencies and provide technology, as well as companies that stand to benefit from blockchain’s myriad uses. 

Each of these aspects of the digital asset ecosystem presents an opportunity for investors. Even if you don’t plan on investing in digital assets, it’s valuable to understand how all the parts fit together.

Knowing the basics: Blockchain and cryptocurrencies
Blockchain is an immutable database that allows data to be recorded and distributed across countless computers globally. It provides benefits in terms of decentralization, security and transparency compared to traditional methods of transacting and sharing information. According to Deloitte, 78% of executive teams see a compelling business case for blockchain.2

Not just for cryptocurrency: Blockchain has a wide—and rapidly expanding—array of uses that could change the way consumers, companies and governments transact and share information. Example uses of blockchain technology include secure medical record storage, insurance claim fraud prevention, and food safety traceability. Some of today’s most well-known companies are leveraging blockchain technology. Take Mastercard3 as an example. Mastercard provides financial transaction processing services and is working to bring select cryptocurrencies onto its payment network to assist merchants in accepting digital payments.4

First invented in 2009, cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money based on blockchain. More precisely, a cryptocurrency is a non-traditional, digital form of currency that is a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to validate and secure transactions. Bitcoin is the first and most widely used cryptocurrency, and other cryptocurrencies collectively are referred to as altcoins. The space continues to grow and evolve as new players come to market.

Here’s why.
Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
What is stagflation?
It’s an environment characterized by economic stagnation combined with inflation.
Some investors are concerned
The main example of stagflation that people rightly worry about was during the 1970s.
We don’t anticipate stagflation next year
In short, our view is that stagflation is an extremely unlikely scenario in 2022.

Now that our 2022 outlook is out, one of the questions I am getting is why we don’t believe 2022 will be a “stagflationary” environment in the United States.
Well, let’s start with the definition of stagflation. Investopedia defines stagflation as an environment “characterized by slow economic growth and relatively high unemployment — or economic stagnation — which is at the same time accompanied by rising prices (i.e., inflation).”
Let’s look at each component of that definition:

Inflation. In terms of the inflation portion of the definition, we have certainly seen rising prices. In fact, November US Consumer Price Index data was released on Friday, showing that headline inflation rose 6.8% year over year — which is the highest level since 1991.1 And yes, we do think inflation could remain high — and even rise further — in coming months. However, our base case for 2022  expects the rate of increase to peak by mid-year as supply chain issues resolve, vaccination levels increase, and more employees return to the workforce. So in the back half of 2022, we do not expect prices to continue to rise at a quickening pace. By that time, the rising prices portion of the stagflation definition is unlikely to apply, in our view.
Economic growth. But where we really think the stagflation definition does not apply even today is when it comes to economic growth. Based on gross domestic product, economic growth is well above trend in the United States and, even though we anticipate it decelerating in 2022, we believe it will remain modestly above trend. What’s more, unemployment is low and has been improving quickly. For example, this past week, initial jobless claims in the United States clocked in at 184,000 — the lowest level since 1969.2 We believe the United States is likely to see continued improvement in employment and reach pre-pandemic levels of unemployment in 2022.

How might 2022 compare with 1970s stagflation?
It’s also worth thinking about how the 2022 macro environment might compare to past periods of stagflation.
The main example of stagflation that people rightly worry about was during the 1970s — specifically 1973 and 1979, when inflation shot up following the Arab Oil Embargo and the Iranian Oil Embargo, respectively. These two major oil shocks weren’t the only challenge back then, but they were certainly a big part of the problem because they drove inflation up sharply and they hit growth hard all over the world.
So what’s different today? It’s true that energy prices have surged sharply, but it is more demand-driven than supply-driven. While OPEC+ has instituted some production controls that have seriously limited the growth in output, the current rise in energy prices has been largely driven by demand as economies have re-opened. And more importantly, the global economy is far less energy intensive now than it was in the 1970s.
Now some have suggested that semiconductors are to this economy what energy was to the economy of the 1970s. There is certainly some truth to that — we have become far more dependent on semiconductors; they are part of a variety of products, from washing machines to automobiles to cell phones. And while there have been serious supply shortages for semiconductors, their production is not controlled by a cartel such as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the 1970s. Semiconductor manufacturers want to increase supply to meet demand; there is just a time lag given the need to build foundries to increase production. And it appears that the worst is behind us in terms of semiconductor shortages, which is welcome news as we head into 2022.
Other parts of the 1970s story were, in our view, much worse and much more “stagflationary” than today, especially crucial government actions. In 1973, the Nixon administration imposed price and wage controls and rationing. These included requiring Americans to buy gasoline on odd- or even-numbered calendar days, depending on their license plate numbers. These were effectively Soviet-type policies, which created shortages — first they repressed growth and consumption, and then they boosted inflation when the controls were lifted.
While there are shortages today, they’re not due to price controls. In fact, inflation and rising wages should eventually cause more production and more people to come back into the labor market. The shortages reflect pandemic-related problems in the supply chains and deliveries, rather than embargoes or boycotts.
The Nixon administration also de-linked the dollar from gold, and the value of the dollar initially fell quite significantly. This boosted the price in dollar terms of all commodities, including energy, as well as goods. Today, in contrast, the dollar is strong and is tending to appreciate, not fall — which should reduce upward pressure on commodity and goods prices.
Moreover — and perhaps most importantly — the Federal Reserve made major mistakes in the 1960s and ’70s. Most important of these was that the Fed repeatedly caved into presidential pressure for easy monetary policy. In 1965, then-US President Lyndon B. Johnson put enormous pressure on the Fed to maintain an easy money policy. It went so far that Johnson reportedly physically attacked Fed Chair William McChesney Martin, throwing him into a wall, when he refused to heed Johnson’s request and instead raised rates.3 After this attack, the Fed didn’t raise rates again until after Johnson decided not to run for re-election in 1968, but instead tried to use regulation to slow credit growth (albeit with little success).
In 1973, the Fed cut rates under political pressure from then-President Richard Nixon, even though inflation was rising, which helped spur a further acceleration in consumer prices. Nixon infamously said that he respected the Fed’s independence, but expected his Fed Chair, Arthur Burns, to independently draw the same conclusions as him.4
Inflation is again a political problem for the Biden administration. In fact, it may be the single biggest problem going into the mid-term elections, with President Joe Biden recently saying that bringing down inflation is his top priority. That gives the Fed another reason to focus more on inflation than on economic growth. An additional reason is that the Fed is starting from a position of extreme accommodation, and so it likely feels more comfortable — and perhaps believes there is a greater need — for normalization of some sort. And so Powell’s Fed could be different than the Burns or Martin Feds, which allowed inflation to run without tightening policy, with the Burns Fed actually easing further. We expect the Fed will normalize monetary policy by not only tapering asset purchases but accelerating that tapering at its meeting this week. In other words, it is taking a far more proactive stance in tackling inflation. Now I continue to believe there is a much higher hurdle for raising rates, which is appropriate, but that doesn’t mean we won’t see a rate hike by mid-2022 depending on economic conditions.
Conclusion
In short, our view is that stagflation is an extremely unlikely scenario in 2022. But that doesn’t mean that the Fed isn’t concerned about inflation — in fact, moving closer to its “full employment” target means it can focus more on inflation. Navigating the current inflationary environment will not be easy for the Fed. It seems the most appropriate response for the Fed right now should be a relatively neutral policy, neither too loose (to avoid pumping up demand because supply is restricted), nor tight (because that could interfere with investment in raising supply to ease bottlenecks and shortages).

Key takeaways
3D printing technology is on the rise
Companies across a wide range of industries are making use of this technology in increasingly complex ways, from body parts to skate parks.
We believe 3D printing companies are poised for success
Despite an underwhelming past few years, we feel these companies offer growth potential over our forward looking 10-year investment horizon

It’s an exciting time in the world of 3D printing. This technology, which involves creating a three-dimensional object out of layers of material added together, is being used in a wide range of increasingly different applications. 
3D printing is already playing a major role in health care, with many researchers working on ways to 3D print human organs.1 Around the world, builders and developers are finding creative ways to make use of this technology as well. In Prague, the world’s first 3D-printed parkour park recently opened.2 Meanwhile, an entire town of 3D-printed homes has been built in Mexico.3 3D printing’s applications even extend beyond Earth; the European Space Agency is testing the ability to 3D print spare parts in space, to be used for a potential future moon base.4

While many of us have heard about the concept of 3D printing, this technology has yet to really impact our daily lives the way some other major innovations have, and over the last several years, many companies that operate in this area have disappointed investors.

One of the tenets of our investment philosophy on Invesco Global Opportunities Fund is the behavioral observation that humans tend to overestimate the progress that can be made in one year, and underestimate the progress that can be made in 10 years. Therefore, an area full of disruptive innovation like 3D printing, which has underwhelmed over the last few years, offers a set of very interesting opportunities over our forward looking 10-year investment horizon.

Where do we see the potential for growth?

Consider 3D Systems Corp., a major manufacturer of 3D printing hardware and materials. Based in Rock Hill, South Carolina, their products allow the design and production of all manner of shapes and prototypes. Unlike traditional plastic manufacturing techniques, which are limited to shapes which you can mold or cut, 3D Systems’ products allow prototype designers virtually boundless flexibility. The company has cleaned up or sold off some ancillary businesses over the last few years, and we feel it is in a much better competitive and financial situation now than in the past. 

One of 3D Systems’ most important customers is the medical device company Align Technology, which has revolutionized the orthodontic industry. Rather than using traditional metal braces to fix crooked teeth, Align instead uses 3D Systems’ hardware to create customized plastic retainers based on the shape and pattern of each patient’s teeth. Over the years, Align has 3D printed million of plastic aligners — each unique to the individual patient, as well as to the stage of treatment for each patient. Such mass customization simply wouldn’t be possible with traditional manufacturing techniques. The result is an orthodontic treatment that is faster, more comfortable, and more convenient for the patient than previous techniques. 
3D Systems and Align are both American companies, but the 3D printing theme is a great example of why a global approach to investing is so important. This holistic perspective has led us to several other world-class 3D printing companies that are helping to transform their respective industries.

SLM Solutions is a German company that specializes in 3D printing of metals. The “SLM” stands for Selective Laser Melting, which is a great description of the process this company’s hardware uses. Its most advanced machines use 12 lasers at once, all operating in perfect harmony with fine control and precision, to melt metal powders into the shapes and parts needed for its customers. SLM’s machines can work with a wide array of metals such as titanium, aluminum, iron, chromium, and all sorts of alloys, and it has customers across the aerospace and automotive industries (including Rolls Royce, GE, and Porsche), along with other industrial use cases. Such applications demand both durability and precision, and SLM’s expertise has been very important to innovation in these areas. 

Materialise is a Belgian provider of 3D printing software. It provides the means for people to interact with and program 3D printers, and to optimize the 3D printing process to ensure it happens in the most efficient way possible. Its software is currently used to design a wide variety of interesting goods, from custom eyewear, dynamic insoles for running shoes, and lightweight luggage. 3D printing software is a very specialized, niche industry right now, but we think Materialise has big potential for the future as these techniques become more widespread.

BICO is a Swedish company that is one of the newer and most innovative businesses in our portfolio. It has the technology to 3D print human tissue, layering cells together to create different types of structures. They can produce skin cells for the purposes of cosmetics testing, or patient-specific heart tissue to aid people with damaged heart muscles after a cardiac episode. Over the long term, we think BICO’s technology can eventually be used to 3D print entire new organs, using a patient’s own stem cells to eliminate the reliance of donors and the risk of transplant rejection. BICO has partnerships with leading global firms and institutions, such as L’Oreal, Johnson & Johnson, and Harvard, and is a great example of the type of small, innovative firm to which our fund is designed to provide clients with exposure.


We continue to focus on the powerful structural growth trends that are playing out in the world economy, and on the small, innovative companies we believe are best-positioned to capture the rewards that flow from these trends over a multi-year period. The changes taking place in areas like 3D printing can create significant economic value for investors over our 10-year investment horizon, and we remain excited about the potential for these companies in the years to come.

Key takeaways
Weakening commodity prices, a new COVID variant, and more saw midstream equities move lower last month
However, the midstream sector’s fundamental strength was highlighted by strong Permian volume growth and better than expected earnings reports.
Third-quarter earnings season wrapped up last month
Operating performance was, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA coming in 0.8% higher than consensus estimates and 2.7% higher than the preceding quarter.
Production of crude oil from the Permian basin has returned to peak volumes
This strong natural gas volume growth points toward the need for additional takeaway capacity by the end of 2023.

Midstream equities moved lower over the month of November as commodity prices weakened alongside a new virus variant and OPEC/US supply jawboning. Despite the sour headlines, strong Permian volume growth and better than expected earnings reports highlight the underlying fundamental strength of the midstream sector.
MLP market overview

Midstream MLPs, as measured by the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), ended November down 8.6% on a price basis and down 7.5% after distributions are considered. The AMZ underperformed the S&P 500 Index’s 0.7% loss for the month. The best-performing midstream subsector for November was the Natural Gas Pipeline group, while the Compression subsector underperformed, on average.
For the year through November, the AMZ is up 24.5% on a price basis, resulting in a 35.0% total return. This compares to the S&P 500 Index’s 21.6% and 23.2% price and total returns, respectively. The Gathering and Processing group has produced the best average total return year-to-date, while the Propane subsector has lagged.
MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-Year US Treasury Bond, widened by 95 basis points (bps) over the month, exiting the period at 682 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 697 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 431 bps. The AMZ distribution yield at month-end was 8.3%.

Midstream MLPs and affiliates raised no new marketed equity (common or preferred, excluding at-the-market programs) and issued $1.2 billion of new debt during the month. MLPs and affiliates announced no new asset acquisitions over the month.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil exited the month at $66.18 per barrel, down 20.8% over the period but 46.0% higher year-over-year. Natural gas prices ended November at $4.57 per million British thermal units (MMbtu), down 15.8% over the month and 58.5% higher than November 2020. Natural gas liquids (NGL) priced at Mont Belvieu exited the month at $38.31 per barrel, 20.8% lower than the end of October and 21.0% higher than the year-ago period.
News

Third-quarter earnings season concluded. Third-quarter reporting season wrapped up in November. Through month-end, 48 midstream entities had announced distributions for the quarter, including six distribution increases, one reduction, and 41 distributions that were unchanged from the previous quarter. Through the end of November, 53 sector participants had reported third-quarter financial results. Operating performance was, on average, better than expectations with EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, coming in 0.8% higher than consensus estimates and 2.7% higher than the preceding quarter.
EnLink plans to move another plant to the Permian. EnLink Midstream (NYSE: ENLC) announced plans to move another of its natural gas processing plants from Oklahoma to Texas. The Thunderbird processing facility will be moved from an out-of-favor region in Oklahoma to the Permian Basin in Texas where ENLC’s existing system has experienced robust growth and is again nearing its operating capacity. The relocation strategy represents cost savings of approximately 50% over illustrative new-build costs and will be the second such move by ENLC. Notably, Targa Resources (NYSE: TRGP) has also employed a similar approach, moving underutilized processing plants from other areas of Texas into the Permian Basin.

ONEOK restarted projects previously paused due to COVID. ONEOK (NYSE: OKE) announced plans to complete previously announced natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) infrastructure projects, including the Demicks Lake III plant, a 200 million-cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) natural gas processing facility in the Williston Basin, and MB-5, a 125,000-barrel per day (bpd) NGL fractionator, in Mont Belvieu, Texas. OKE noted that, ""Increasing producer activity and improving demand for natural gas and NGLs drove the decision to restart these attractive return projects."" 
Chart of the month: Permian back to peak volumes 

According to the US Energy Information Administration’s latest Drilling Productivity Report,1 production of crude oil from the Permian basin is expected to reach 4.95 million barrels per day (MMbbls/d) in December 2021, exceeding the prior peak of 4.91 MMbbls/d hit in March 2020. Production of natural gas from the Permian basin recovered sooner, exceeding the prior peak back in April. The EIA expects December natural gas production of 19.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), more than 11% higher than the March 2020 peak of 17.4 Bcf/d. This strong natural gas volume growth is pointing toward the need for additional takeaway capacity by the end of 2023.

Key takeaways
The debt ceiling was created in 1939 when Congress established an aggregate upper limit for outstanding public debt
While the rationale for a debt ceiling has ebbed and flowed over time, the direction of the debt ceiling has only moved in one way (up).
Since World War II, the debt ceiling has been raised or suspended more than 98 times
This precedent of raising the debt ceiling has been put to the test over the past 10 to 15 years, as both political parties seek to maximize any potential or perceived leverage.
We now find ourselves in a situation in which a 50-50 Senate has been deadlocked over increasing the debt limit
The brinksmanship of July seems to be behind us, however, as Senate Leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer appear to have struck a deal to lift the debt limit.

Washington has become quite adept at manufacturing crises in recent years. Indeed, this fall, both political parties have been engaged in brinksmanship toward another self-generated catastrophe — this time concerning the looming debt ceiling deadline. But what is the debt ceiling anyway, and why has it become such a political cudgel? Let’s take a quick look by answering three key questions.
What is the debt ceiling?

The United States has incurred debt since its inception, starting with the debt accumulated during the Revolutionary War. And while the public debt grew in the early years of the country, it was reduced to zero in 1835 under the presidency of Andrew Jackson and remained relatively tame for some time except for times of war1 — especially the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Generally speaking, Congress would approve each issuance of new debt concomitant with legislation that sought to incur the debt, and the concept of a hard ceiling on debt was not considered necessary.

However, in 1939, Congress for the first time established an aggregate upper limit for outstanding public debt. According to the Congressional Research Service, “The statutory debt limit applies to almost all federal debt. The limit applies to federal debt held by the public (that is, debt held outside the federal government itself) and to federal debt held by the government's own accounts. Federal trust funds, such as Social Security, Medicare, Transportation, and Civil Service Retirement accounts, hold most of this internally held debt.”2 According the Budget Counsel Reference Directory, “approximately 0.5% of total debt is excluded from debt limit coverage.”3

While the rationale for a debt limit (or debt ceiling) has ebbed and flowed over time, the direction of the debt ceiling has only moved in one way (up).

Vice President of Federal Government Affairs


An unmistakable bad habit of Washington is to focus on the next election almost immediately after the last vote from the previous election is counted, and 2021 is no different. The evenly divided Senate and razor-thin, three-seat Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is evidence of the precarious nature of power these days. Yet, like his three immediate predecessors, President Joe Biden is enjoying same-party control of Congress to help deliver on his agenda, including the $1.9 trillion American Recovery Act, among other potential relief measures still working their way through both chambers. But as fall comes to Washington, there is something in the air that is causing a chill among Democrats – a seemingly inevitable conclusion that they are almost certain to lose control of at least one chamber of Congress in T minus 13 months.
History is not on the side of Democrats. Over the past 100 years, the president’s party has gained seats in the House in only three out of 25 midterm elections (12%).1 Each of these three trend-breaking elections must be studied individually for context.

In 1934, Democrats gained nine seats in the House and secured a supermajority in the Senate during President Franklin Roosevelt’s first term, which took place in the midst of the Great Depression. Prior to 1934, the president’s party had failed to gain seats in any midterm election since the Civil War.
In 1998, Democrats gained five seats in the House, but did not gain a sufficient number to claim the majority. The election took place in the middle of President Bill Clinton’s second term and was widely seen as a rebuke of the House Republican majority and their pursuit of impeachment. Clinton’s approval rating was in the high 60s prior to the election.
In 2002, Republicans gained eight seats in the House in a post-9/11 election that was dominated by security concerns. President George W. Bush’s approval rating was in the high 60s prior to the election.

At no point in his presidency has Biden enjoyed an approval rating above 60%. So, while not impossible, it would seem likely that the 2022 midterm election will cost the Democrats their slim majority in the House. Recent history for first-term presidents further illustrates the trend that Biden will be fighting against:

In 1994, during Clinton’s first midterm, Democrats lost 52 House seats.
In 2010, during President Barack Obama’s first midterm, Democrats lost 62 House seats.
In 2018, during President Donald Trump’s first midterm, Republicans lost 41 House seats.

Beyond these historical trend lines, Biden and the Democrats will also face a challenge that comes only once a decade – redistricting. With the results of the decennial census collected, states are currently working through their respective processes to draw new lines for congressional districts in advance of the 2022 midterm. Based on population trends over the past decade, traditionally GOP-dominated states like Texas, Montana, North Carolina, and Florida all gained seats, while traditionally Democratic-dominated states like California, Illinois, Michigan, and New York all lost seats. What gets even more concerning for Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) is that the mechanism to draw new lines varies from state to state, and the failure of Democrats to extend their 2020 federal election gains into state elections means that many states will have unified Republican control of redistricting. The result? Unfavorable maps for House Democrats. Recent projections by political analysts at the Cook Political Report suggest Republicans will likely gain a net two to five seats alone based on redistricting, and that’s before you get to the traditional midterm penalty described above.
History and math aside, Biden and his allies in Congress still have ample time to deliver on their promises to the electorate and buck the dreaded first midterm trend. It has been done several times before, but without 60%-plus popularity for the president, some other force may need to be in play. Enter former President Donald Trump. How engaged is he in the midterm elections? Is he able to motivate his voters to come to the polls even though he is not on the ballot? Or does he just motivate the opposition like he did in the Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5? We’ll see.
Who holds the reins of redistricting?
The highlighted states are ones in which the legislature has primary responsibility for congressional redistricting or votes on plans submitted to it. Of those 35 states, 11 are led by Democrats, 20 by Republicans, and four are split.

A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan that allows you to contribute toward a loved one’s education. If used to pay for qualified education expenses, the earnings are free from federal income tax and, in most cases, state income tax.
What is accelerated gifting?
Accelerated gifting is a special provision of 529 plans that permits a contributor to combine five years of contributions (the current year plus four future years) in a single year.
This allows a gift of up to $75,000 for an individual contributor or $150,000 for couples filing jointly (five times the current annual gifting limit per beneficiary). However, no additional gifts may be made until five years have passed.
Gift and estate tax benefits on accelerated contributions
You can gift significant amounts from your estate and keep control of your assets as the account owner.
In 2021, gifts totaling up to $15,000 per individual ($30,000 per couple) will qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion.
If you contribute between $15,000 and $75,000 for a beneficiary, you can elect to treat the contribution as made over a five calendar-year period for gift tax purposes.
College expenses and student debt
Start investing early for your loved one’s future education costs. In 2021-22, average budgets for full-time undergraduate students range from $18,830 for public two-year in-district students and $27,330 for public four-year in-state students to $44,150 for public four-year out-of-state students and $55,800 for private nonprofit four-year students.
Ways you can contribute
Anyone can fund a 529 plan, including grandparents, aunts and uncles, and family friends. Contributions can be made via check or online, but services like Ugift can make it even simpler. Account owners receive a unique Ugift code tied to their 529 plan account, which friends and family can use to make direct contributions. Give the gift they won’t outgrow.

As plan participants prepare for the transition to retirement, there are many things to consider, including what to do with the money they’ve saved in their employers’ retirement plans. They may not realize that they can keep their assets in these plans instead of moving (or “rolling over”) their balance to an individual retirement account (IRA). Not only is this an easier approach, but staying in plan offers participants three potential benefits:

Lower fees: Plan participants can potentially avoid higher fees — often found in IRAs — since their employers’ retirement plans may have the size and scale to offer lower-priced, high-quality investments.
Ongoing retirement resources and support: When participants are ready to retire, they’ll continue to have access to the same wealth of resources and tools available to support their financial well-being.

Investment oversight: Unlike some IRAs, an employer acts as a plan fiduciary with its employees’ best interests in mind when evaluating fees, fund performance, and suitability of the investments offered.

Key takeaways
Margins
The topping process can take over a year to complete. In the meantime, margins may remain high, providing a potentially ample albeit fading tailwind for earnings and stock market returns.
Inflation
If it weren’t for accelerating producer prices, total business sales could be advancing at a significantly slower pace.
Sectors
Historically, energy stocks outperformed in hotter inflation environments, and consumer discretionary stocks outperformed in cooler inflation environments.

Despite investor concerns about lofty valuations and liquidity-fueled asset price inflation, stocks have behaved largely as I expected in the second year of this new market cycle by growing into their price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples.1
Indeed, the S&P 500 Index’s exceptional 25% year-to-date (YTD) price return has been driven by a 65% surge in trailing four-quarter operating earnings per share (EPS) in the same timeframe.2 Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index’s P/E ratio has compressed by 25% to 23x from 31x at the end of last year.2
In other words, US stocks have produced strong double-digit gains alongside positive earnings growth – as they’ve done during similar periods over the past 31 years – regardless of what multiples did!1
What’s behind the surge in corporate profits?
One method of potentially forecasting bottom-line earnings is to project top-line revenues and apply a suitable profit margin.
Encouragingly, trailing four-quarter sales per share (SPS) have grown by a robust 11% YTD on the back of the ongoing global economic expansion.2
As impressive as that is, however, net profit margins – or the percentage of income remaining after all the bills are paid – have soared 40% YTD to an all-time high of 13% from 9% at year-end 2020 (Figure 1)!

Inflation
Oil price trends and moderate underlying pressure reassure us that the current inflation “scare” should pass in time.
Chinese growth
Past Chinese policy tightening is giving way to renewed policy easing, which should boost the outlook for emerging market stocks.
SARS-CoV-2 cases
Secondary coronavirus infections have been shrinking rapidly in the US.

Halloween is right around the corner, and investors are feeling fearful about a number of valid issues. Fortunately, I believe we’re seeing signs that these concerns should become less scary as time goes on. Below I discuss three of these issues in particular: Inflation, Chinese economic growth, and coronavirus cases.
Scare #1 – Inflation
First and foremost on their list of worries is an inflation “scare” that’s currently gripping the marketplace. As shown in Figure 1, core personal spending inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) has soared above 3.6% year-over-year, the fastest pace since the early 1990s. However, oil price inflation – a key driver of headline inflation – has decelerated sharply as oil prices have risen at a significantly slower pace. In my view, the strong influence and leading characteristic of oil points to an easing of non-food and energy inflation, albeit with a lagged effect.

Key takeaways
Risk assets appear to be looking up
We believe a new cycle has emerged, providing the fundamental catalyst for a sustainable long-term rally.
We foresee a long emerging market and business cycle
A prolonged period of slow growth, low inflation and rates, and massive policy accommodations will likely push credit and equities higher.

To assess whether a prolonged “risk-on” environment has emerged, it is important to focus on what we know about market cycles. While no two market cycles are identical, they tend to follow similar patterns. This time has been no different, the global pandemic notwithstanding.
In the following commentary, we articulate what we know about the early stages of elongated market and business cycles, and liken those trends to the current market and economic environment. The inevitable near-term potential for increased volatility aside, our conclusion is that a new cycle has emerged and is providing the fundamental catalyst for a sustainable long-term rally in risk assets. 
Bear markets typically portend economic recessions rather than persist through the early and middle stages of the recovery. In the US, there have been six instances since 1930 when stocks experienced market declines of greater than 30%. In every instance, stocks were meaningfully higher one and three years after the trough, the inevitable volatility and market corrections along the way notwithstanding.1 This year, global stocks experienced a full-blown recessionary bear market in roughly 20 trading days. The market trough, as has typically been the case, coincided with extreme volatility, lopsided investor positioning, and dire sentiment globally. By early May, investors had largely capitulated with trillions of dollars seeking the relative safety of government bonds and cash-like assets.
Inevitably, at such times, policy responses emerge and financial conditions ease. If the adage for investors has historically been “don’t fight the Fed,” we can now likely expand that to include almost every other central bank in the world, as well as the European Commission and the US Congress. As has historically been the case, the beginning of cycles can be terminated with bad policy mixes. In this instance, we think the likelihood of a policy mistake is low. Expansionary monetary policy has already had its intended effect. Inflation expectations have largely recovered from albeit depressed levels, the US dollar has been weakening against a broad basket of other currencies, industrial commodity prices have stabilized, and credit spreads have compressed. On the fiscal side, policymakers, including the US Congress and the European Commission, appear poised to provide ample support to economies.
“Risk-on” periods can emerge even as broad economies remain challenged. Remember, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it took many years for mortgage default rates to peak, for households to de-lever their balance sheets, and for full employment to emerge. Nonetheless, stocks staged a sound advance. While there are signs of sound recoveries in certain segments of the global economy (like China manufacturing, US housing, and retail sales), other segments of the global economy remain challenged. Economic conditions could potentially worsen in the near term as rising COVID-19 cases in many US states and select cities of the world could lead to renewed shutdowns and decreased human mobility. Importantly, however, we would not expect the same shutdown measures as witnessed earlier in the year. We know far more about this virus now than we did in March 2020 (the benefits of masks, social distancing, and the lower risk of outdoor gatherings) that should support the compression of cases and enable a gradual continuation of the economic recovery. Also, we would expect weak and intermittent recoveries to be consistent with extended and even advanced monetary and fiscal policy accommodation globally. As always, investors should be focused in the coming quarters not on whether economic conditions are good or bad, but rather on whether conditions are likely to get modestly better.
Finally, global equity valuations, although not necessarily cheap on an absolute basis, remain attractive to many alternatives, including developed market government-related securities. The discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows is near zero in much of the developed world, suggesting that investors will likely be willing to pay higher multiples of earnings over time. Equity investors should, however, be mindful of the types of businesses they want to own for the long term. Market leadership will likely come down to which businesses are the disruptors and which businesses are being disrupted. The high-flying winners in this market are disrupting the way the economy, business, and society operate. We may end up paying higher equity multiples on those businesses than for the broader market, but it seems reasonable to expect those business will grow their earnings faster than the broader market does.
Ultimately, we expect this new emerging market and business cycle to be among the longest on record, perhaps even surpassing that of the post-2008 period. A prolonged period of slow growth, low inflation, low interest rates and massive policy accommodations will likely be a period that is conducive to sound performance from credit and equities. Investors should expect volatility along the way, particularly if concerns about re-opening the economy persist, but we believe that betting long-term against credit and equities now would be akin to betting against medicine, science, human ingenuity, and the direction of monetary policy. That is not a bet that we would be willing to make.

Brian Levitt
Global Market Strategist
Key takeaways
The Fed gets aggressive on inflation
The Federal Reserve will more aggressively taper its monthly bond purchases and might raise interest rates as many as three times in 2022.
Markets took the plan in stride
In the context of an inflationary economic boom in the US, the scheduled removal of extraordinary monetary support appears reasonable.
There’s room to tighten
The positive slope of the yield curve suggests there’s room for the Fed to tighten before policy and financial conditions become restrictive.

In response to rising inflation, the Federal Reserve (Fed) announced on Dec. 15 that it would more aggressively taper its monthly bond purchases and might raise interest rates as many as three times in 2022. It’s the type of announcement that caused markets to “tantrum” in the past, but this time the broad US market largely took the news in stride. So what comes next? Global Market Strategist Brian Levitt and Equity Strategist Talley Léger discuss the immediate aftermath of the announcement and what they expect ahead.
Brian: The Fed seemed to have telegraphed their message to the market. By now we had all expected them to accelerate the tapering of their asset purchases and to put in place expectations for multiple rate hikes in 2022. I’m not surprised to have seen the broad US market thus far largely take it in stride. The S&P 500 Index is a stone’s throw from an all-time high. However, in the aftermath of the announcement, bonds rallied, the dollar weakened, cyclical value sectors led the way while the secular growth stocks within the information technology sector were down meaningfully. It’s the anti-taper tantrum! In the immortal words of coach Vince Lombardi, “What the (heck’s) going on out here?”
Talley: In my humble opinion, the decline in both long-term bond yields and tech stock prices is contradictory. I don’t think markets and investors can have it both ways. In my view, the Fed is taking its foot off the gas pedal into an already slowing economy, which I would expect to favor growth “surrogate” stocks like tech. From that perspective, the fact that 10-year US Treasury yields are now lower than they were in March makes perfect sense. It also seems the bond market is looking past hot inflation prints, given that consumers’ 5- to 10-year inflation expectations appear well-anchored for the time being.
While the accelerated tapering schedule was well communicated, it’s possible that the stepped-up timeline for interest-rate hikes rattled some equity investors, causing a near-term shakeout in tech stocks. Ultimately, however, I’d take my cue for equity sector positioning from the bond market, which has been rallying across the curve. I can’t remember who said it first, but doesn’t the bond market get it right more often than the stock market?
Brian: It is also said that the first interest rate hike of a cycle isn’t what matters, it’s the last one. I’m old enough to remember market performance in the years following the cycles’ first interest-rate hikes in 1994 and 2015, which was quite strong and led by growth companies. But in those years, inflation was quite tame compared to today. Inflation expectations, as represented by the inflation breakeven, appear to have peaked in mid-November. When it comes to style and sector positioning, do you have other indicators to suggest that this is a sea change?
Talley: Interestingly, the yield curve – the difference between 10- and 2-year Treasury bond yields for example – has steepened a bit in the immediate wake of the Fed’s announcement. I bring it up because it’s a classic indicator to watch for a potential rotation away from growthy tech stocks to deep-value financials, so it’s worth monitoring. One day doesn’t make a trend, but so far we’ve seen a bull steepening of the yield curve, meaning shorter-term bond yields have been falling more than longer-term ones. Personally, those intra-bond market dynamics don’t get me excited about economic growth prospects enough to dive into deep value financials. How about you?
Brian: I would think that the more value-oriented sectors may struggle to find a catalyst here. Growth is slowing, the Omicron variant appears to be spreading rapidly (it’s still too soon to tell the severity of cases, but early indications may be promising) and policy is tightening at the margin. As I write that, I realize it sounds somewhat ominous. Do you worry about how this all plays out? Take us home. What might the next 12 months look like?
Talley: In the context of an inflationary (albeit moderating) economic boom in the US, I think the scheduled removal of extraordinary monetary support is reasonable. Let’s be clear: We’re experiencing the first soft patch of this new business cycle, not necessarily an acute slowdown that immediately precedes an economic recession. That time will come, as it always does, but the positive slope of the yield curve suggests there’s room for the Fed to tighten before policy and financial conditions become restrictive. If that’s right, I’m inclined to stick to the growth style of investing and tech stocks, which generally still offer rapid sales and earnings growth rates.
Should some combination of fading Omicron concerns, increased mobility, cooling inflation, and a less hawkish Fed materialize, we must be prepared for a potential economic reacceleration and an associated shift in style and sector positioning. But if that happens, we’ll be loud about it.

I think there’s time left on the clock for economy-sensitive, pro-cyclical, risk-on trades to keep working.

As I expected, the economy-sensitive segments of the stock market have enjoyed an impressive run since their early-2020 lows.1 Now, investors are naturally wondering whether the bulk of the pro-cyclical advance is behind them.
Granted, government bond yields have softened on the back of a China-led early-to-mid cycle slowdown (Figure 1).2 Admittedly, those dynamics could challenge my bullish “reflation” thesis but ultimately may present another attractive entry point for cyclicals, in my view.

Brian Levitt
Global Market Strategist
Key takeaways
The market sees a rally
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the economy and markets teetered, then recovered quickly.
Tailwinds and headwinds abound
There are several notable tailwinds behind stocks, but also some bearish pressures.
Short-term turbulence could produce long-term opportunities
Weak, protracted recoveries with overly accommodative policy may be good for equities in the long term.

In the months since the initial coronavirus outbreak, we saw the economy and markets teeter on the brink of collapse, only to recover quickly. We recently sat down to discuss the sustainability of this recent recovery.   
Brian: I’m going to start with a compliment if you promise to not let it go to your head.  Your market bottom framework proved prescient in late March as extreme volatility, catastrophic investor sentiment, lopsided investor positioning, and disastrous market breadth led you to opine that the market was bottoming. Fast-forward 17 weeks and the US equity market has almost fully recovered. First, what drove the market retracement and what is an investor to do now? 
Talley: You’re too kind — and give me far too much credit. It’s one thing to provide investors with a framework and indicators to help get their arms around the bottoming process in stocks. It’s another thing entirely to correctly call the shape of the recovery. I admit to being surprised by the V-shaped rebound in stocks, and the fact that the market didn’t re-test the March low.
As far as I can tell, there are at least nine tailwinds behind stocks:

Massive, unprecedented, and coordinated monetary policy support
Similarly impressive fiscal policy support
Still cautious investor positioning in the form of high cash balances and net short positions in stocks
Negative investor sentiment as expressed by persistent outflows from stocks and more bears than bulls in the individual investor survey
Structurally oversold conditions in the rolling 20-year total returns on stocks
Potential treatments for the disease caused by the coronavirus that is being researched and developed by a host of companies around the world, some of which have moved to human trials
Potential vaccines for the coronavirus itself that are evolving at a similar pace
The fact that high-frequency economic data like weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance have improved
The fact that the economy is re-opening and activity is moving in the right direction, as evidenced by the daily mobility data1

That said, there’s also a bearish case to be made for the market, namely:

Fears of a potentially deadly second wave of the coronavirus as the economy re-opens and cooler fall weather approaches
The risk of a negative feedback loop between stocks and second-quarter 2020 gross domestic production and earnings per share
Heightened US-China tensions
Overvaluation
Tactically overbought conditions

All are valid points, any one of which could be the catalyst for a near-term pullback in stocks.
Nonetheless, I remain compelled by the comparative breadth and scope of the bullish case, which leads me to believe investors should consider any short-term turbulence as a long-term “buy and hold” opportunity.
Brian: I, too, am compelled by the comparative breadth and scope of the bullish case. I think the adage is now “don’t fight the Federal Reserve (Fed) and every other central bank in the world, as well as the European Commission and the US Congress.” Addressing your bear case, there has already been a new surge in cases and while the US economy is slowing, it does not appear to be collapsing as it did during The Great Shutdown. Mobility may have plateaued (I, for one, haven’t gone to too many places in the past few months) but it does not appear to be collapsing. For the time being and until we make a medical breakthrough, I suspect we will take proper precautions — masks, outdoor gatherings, social distancing — to avoid the draconian shutdowns and disastrous economic collapse of earlier in the year. Valuations, overall, are elevated but the discount rate keeps falling. In a near-zero interest rate world, I suspect we need to get comfortable paying higher multiples on equities. 
Regardless of whether there is a near-term pullback, I think we both believe that weak, protracted recoveries complete with overly accommodative policy is good for equities in the long term. How are you positioning for a protracted recovery?
Talley: From a sector and industry perspective, we’re starting to see hints of cyclicality returning to the marketplace after taking the last several weeks off (read: summer doldrums).2 Within technology, semiconductors are making fresh highs relative to software. Elsewhere, both the industrials and materials sectors are firming. Lumber continues to surge, and the homebuilders are still acting well. We’ve also seen copper and the other metals rally (e.g., zinc, tin, nickel, aluminum, and silver).
While making pure, directional calls on the cyclical or defensive sectors of the market is risky, my long-term optimism forces me to take a bullish stance on the US stock market and economic recovery. Like-minded investors should think twice before hedging away the advance.
Not to obsess about a near-term pullback, but does the market’s concentration in a handful of technology companies concern you at all? While the S&P 500 Index may be positive for 2020, can the same be said for most S&P 500 stocks?
Brian: The biggest challenge in trying to time the market or appropriately hedge your portfolio is knowing when to re-risk. Would I be surprised if we see some of the high-flying drivers of the market underperform the more economy-sensitive segments or even give back some of the recent gains? No. History suggests that corrections happen often. 
But again, it’s a timing issue. Equity investors must ask themselves about the types of businesses they want to own for the long term. To me, it comes down to which businesses are the disruptors and which businesses are being disrupted. The high-flying winners in this market are disrupting the way the economy, business, and society operate. We may end up paying higher equity multiples on those businesses than for the broader market, but I would also expect their earnings to grow faster than the broader market.
I’ll give you the final word. How do you view the recent weakness of the dollar? Is this the catalyst to unlock the deep value embedded in international markets?
Talley: The Fed has embarked on a seemingly open-ended commitment to buy securities until the economic and labor market outlooks improve substantially.
An important consequence of the Fed’s unprecedented balance sheet expansion is the weakness of the US dollar, which should reinforce the blossoming rally in international markets, especially in emerging markets (EM) and Chinese stocks.
If quantitative easing represents a choice between interest rates and the US dollar, the Fed has opted to save growth and jobs by loosening the monetary screws and inflating the money supply at the expense of the currency. From that perspective, it’s reasonable to expect the US dollar to weaken further if the Fed keeps such an abundant supply of currency in circulation.
To your point, structural underperformance from Chinese and EM stocks — until recently — has compressed their price-to-sales ratios to deep discounts compared to the world index and history.
While valuation is a good starting point for an investment thesis, it isn’t enough on its own. Attractive valuations coupled with a weakening US dollar and improving economic growth abroad could be a potent tonic for unleashing the potential rewards presented by EM stocks, and so far, it appears to be working.

Key takeaways
The inflation debate heats up
There’s a lot of money in the system, but there’s also a lot of spare capacity and under-employed Americans ready to produce more goods and services.
What do rising rates mean for the market?
We believe it’s far too soon for today’s recovery trade to end, and that these market trends should be considered in terms of years, not months.

As we enter year two of the market recovery, investors face a new set of concerns. Has the economy become too hot, too fast? Are we headed for out-of-control inflation? What are the investment implications of all this?

We tackle these questions, and more, in the latest chapter of our ongoing conversation about the markets and economy.
Talley: It’s hard to believe that a year has passed since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus reached the US. And for many, it’s equally astonishing that the broad US stock market has kept pressing to new highs, alongside forceful blasts of central bank liquidity and government stimulus checks.
Brian: If you had told me in March 2020 that the economy would produce 379,000 jobs in February 2021,1 the 10-year US Treasury yield would be above 1.50%,2 and the 10-year inflation breakeven rate would be over 2.2%,2 then I would have slept much better over the past year.

Talley: True, we didn’t call those levels precisely. In fairness, however, we did get the direction generally right: Up.

Brian: It’s ironic — in year one of recoveries, investors typically ask, “How can the market be going up when the economy is so bad?” And in year two they ask, “Has the economy become too hot, too fast?”  Already, the term “inflation” reached peak popularity as a Google search in the week ended Feb. 27.3 I suppose that’s what happens when the 10-year US Treasury yield climbs by over 60 basis points in a month.
Talley: That wasn’t my doing. I’m one of the people who locked in an all-time low mortgage rate to flee the city and buy a house in the suburbs. So, my Google searches are all about air scrubbers and HVAC media filters nowadays. I’ve never cared so much about air quality before in my life! 
But locking in an ultra-low mortgage rate isn’t the only reason why I’m less concerned about higher bond yields. In my view, the stock market outlook depends on the reason why interest rates are rising. If it’s because real economic growth is picking up, as you correctly point out, that should be good for stocks as corporate earnings improve.

On the other hand, if rates rise because inflation is getting out of control, that should be bad for stocks as their valuations compress. While I wouldn’t rule out an inflation “scare” altogether, I believe such concerns may ultimately prove overblown.

Brian: We’re all debating the inflation question. Top minds in the industry are lining up on different sides. Inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. Sure, there’s a lot of money in the system and more forthcoming from the Biden administration — Congress just passed a $1.9 trillion stimulus package. But there is also a lot of spare capacity and under-employed Americans ready to produce more goods and services.

Talley: The question is which comes first — the demand or supply response. For example, spending could be unleashed on the economy before workers return in full force, thereby raising the general level of prices.

Brian: Correct. But isn’t that an argument for near-term inflation that fades, as fiscal support moderates and workers return to the labor force?

Talley: Agreed. The government has stepped into the breach in counter-cyclical fashion to help restore demand and consumption, which could lead to a temporary increase in prices until supply ramps up. As more people get vaccinated, and more segments of the economy re-open, I think it’s just a matter of time before producers and workers follow their natural desire to produce more at higher prices and receive better wages, respectively. Eventually, the lagged supply response should help prices settle back down to a lower equilibrium.

Brian: And the long-term secular forces against inflation — automation, new technologies, aging populations — haven’t gone away. I may need some new clothes if we return to the office, but I’ll hold off on buying 1970s-style polyester leisure suits.

Here’s another key question: What do rising rates mean for market leadership? For all the hand wringing in recent days, hasn’t this played out exactly as you would have expected?

Talley: Right! As we anticipated in a rising rate environment, cyclicals have been outperforming defensives, value stocks have been outperforming growth stocks, and small-cap equities have been outperforming their large-cap counterparts.

Encouragingly, my research shows that on average, the various elements of past “recovery” trades lasted between four years (in the case of small caps over large caps) and a whopping seven years (in the case of stocks over bonds)! In other words, I think it’s far too soon for today’s recovery trade to end. These market trends should be considered in terms of years, not months. If past is prologue, I think “risk” assets should have plenty of time to keep working.

Brian: Does that recovery trade include growth stocks, particularly technology companies? I understand why speculative technology companies would be hurt as inflation expectations surge. Investors reassess what they’re willing to pay today for stock in businesses that aren’t expected to generate profits for many years to come. But were you surprised to see the “cash cow” technology companies caught in the selloff? 

Talley: Not really. The growth style of investing and the information technology sector outperformed for 13 or more years—the longest growth cycle on record!4 It may seem paradoxical, but growth investment strategies have done better when economic growth is in short supply. It’s an inverse relationship. So, it’s no surprise that we’ve received many questions about the next big rotation toward the value style of investing and the financial sector.

Given relatively more abundant economic growth and a steepening yield curve — a market proxy for wider bank net interest margins — it seems investors may have the cover necessary to abandon stocks with higher forecasted earnings growth rates and pursue cyclical value strategies for now.

While value stocks are poised to benefit from an accelerating economy, in the end, they may return to the “old normal” of structurally impaired economic growth.

The bottom line is I believe the selloff in the broad stock market is a symptom of underlying sector rotation, not a sinister change of trend.

Brian: I concur. Long live the secular bull market.

The Investment Grade Bond Market read like a trilogy in 2021 as meager full-year returns masked three distinct periods, each with a different catalyst and in turn, a different return profile. 
Part One occurred in January and February as negative returns were driven by a sharp rise in long-term interest rates as economic optimism increased. At that time, the initial vaccine rollout was in full swing, pandemic restrictions were being lifted and consumers and businesses, flush with cash from multiple rounds of fiscal stimulus, opened their pocketbooks in a meaningful way. Risk assets rallied as evidenced by tightening corporate credit spreads.

Part Two occurred throughout the summer, as the Delta variant caused COVID-19 case counts to spike and investors to quickly remember the negative impacts the pandemic can have on economies around the world. Much of the rates-driven market selloff from earlier in the year was recovered.
Part Three occurred in the fall and is most suggestive of what we may expect in 2022. A rise in short-term rates was offset by a decline in longer-term rates as investors grappled with a new variant, persistent inflation and a Federal Reserve that is pulling back from crisis-era stimulus. This “flattening” of the yield curve, where short-term rates rise and long-term rates hold steady or fall, began in October, and reflects the competing factors currently at play in the market.

The investments offered in defined contribution plans, and the options participants select, are often focused on traditional asset classes – particularly US equities — despite the wide availability of alternative investment options available in a DC-friendly format that historically have proven beneficial in both lowering portfolio risk exposures and limiting the range of potential participant outcomes 
Real estate offerings were available in only 18.9% of large DC plans and represented a miniscule 0.4% of overall industry DC assets, according to the 2019 Plan Sponsor Council of America 62nd Annual Survey.
Real estate assets remain a strategic part of so many institutional portfolios. Backed by physical commercial or residential properties, these securities offer the potential for capital appreciation as the value of their underlying assets grow, historically providing both attractive growth opportunities and an effective inflation hedge. They also have the ability to generate steady, predictable income. Strategy choice has also expanded, where plan sponsors can now select from direct and public (REIT) real estate investment solutions.

In difficult economic times, employers must often look for ways to cut costs in their defined contribution (DC) plan to help lower their overall expenses or free-up needed cash for other critical areas of their business. In the midst of COVID-19, many plan sponsors are now conducting this evaluation.
They may be looking to either reduce or suspend matching contributions on nonelective contributions, such as profit-sharing. Many plan sponsors took such measures in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, and then eventually resumed contributions at the same levels that were in place before the crisis.
Changes in plans, however, cannot be initiated without careful consideration of the legal and plan design requirements for making such changes.  
This article provides a broad overview of the issues plan sponsors must consider and the steps they must take before making changes in the employer contributions to a DC plan.

Fred Reish shares his views on devising defined contribution plan lineups. Committees often focus on the quality and costs of a plan’s investments. But considering how participants invest is just as important to ensure desirable outcomes for both participants and plan sponsors.
One type of investment that could help participants make better decisions are risk-based strategies. Offering such strategies can help plans:
- Simplify investment lineups
- Reduce fiduciary complexity
- Make investment decisions easier for participants

Shifting DC Times caught up with Emilie Inakazu, Senior Manager, Benefits & Pension in the Total Rewards team at KPMG in Canada. She is responsible for the management of national firm-wide benefits and retirement savings programs, ensuring they remain relevant to the multi-generational workforce across 40 locations in Canada.
In this conversation, she talks with us about the redesign of KPMG in Canada’s Total Rewards program — a dynamic, intuitive, and personalized benefits marketplace centered on employee choice. With 65% of their employees under the age of 35, the Total Rewards team, in partnership with KPMG leaders and employees, focused the program’s redesign in 2018 to better reflect new definitions of lifestyle and wellness, and the current digital “on-demand” experience.
Read on for Emilie’s thoughts on:

How KPMG thinks about their global pensions and benefits
The impetus for the redesign of the Total Rewards program
How the team used design techniques and technology to innovate the program
How the wellness pool of money to which employees now have access differs from previous approaches

Over the past several years, the sole focus on helping employees save for retirement has shifted — by necessity — to also include helping employees turn their savings into an income stream that may need to last for 20 years or more during retirement. For plan sponsors who prefer participants remain in-plan, how can they help them transition from saving to spending in a smart and measured way?
The days of strolling into the sunset with a pension from your long-term employer and spending days filled with leisure are over: Today’s retirement is being redefined every day. What used to be called “retirement” has now evolved to “a second act,” “a post-career life,” and “a new journey.” The transition to retirement has become more fluid, with a majority of employees planning to work — at a full-time or part-time level — well into traditional retirement years.
While the retirement landscape continues to shift, many defined contribution (DC) plans still reflect the outdated vision of retirement with limited distribution options, an investment menu focused on accumulation, and “too-late” communications about the option to stay in the DC plan and the benefits of doing so. Unfortunately, 66% of retirees said their most recent employers did nothing to help with their transition to retirement.1
Whether they plan to continue working full-time, cut back to part-time, or completely retire in the traditional sense, many participants feel unprepared and want help:2

Just 24% are offered help calculating how much to save for retirement, and only 14% receive help planning for health care expenses in retirement.
One in four employees would like their retirement plan to include more investment options designed for after retirement.

To help support participants in this next phase of life, plan sponsors — especially those who prefer participants stay in the plan post-“retirement” — should evolve their retirement programs to include a coordinated approach of retiree-friendly plan design, income-focused investments, and the education, resources, and tools needed for support.
In this article, we cover these three plan considerations in greater detail: 

Provide flexible ways to access retirement savings: Offer a wide range of distribution options and encourage rollovers into the plan.
Help build an income plan: Provide a range of investment menu solutions to help participants build a sustainable income plan.
Start the conversation early with the tools to help: Share the benefits of staying-in-plan and provide the education, resources, and tools needed to build a holistic strategy.

Our 2021 DC language study took a closer look at the language of defined contribution (DC) plans. Alongside Maslansky + Partners, a communications and research strategy firm, we conducted a national survey of 997 large-plan participants to highlight how the right language could help plan sponsors engage, inform, and motivate employees to save for retirement. 
Among our key findings, we learned that when survey participants first joined their current employers’ retirement plan, half (54%) chose their own investments versus being automatically defaulted into the plan’s investment option (46%). Whether participants invest on their own or stay in default options, there’s no question many find their DC investment menu somewhat confusing. What can help?
To begin, we found that participants prefer more control (or the perception of it), rather than less, when it comes to their money. Language conveying that participants have the ultimate decision-making authority over their retirement assets consistently won out — both with participants who preferred to be highly involved with investment decisions, and those who did not.

We also found that participants preferred investment menu names that provide cues about the offerings. While the retirement plan industry often uses a “tier” structure, this language doesn’t provide any context to participants. Instead, sponsors should present the investment menu with clear and descriptive titles.
When deciding how to present target date and target risk options, positive framing is important. Participants were significantly less likely to select from a group of funds that ranged along a higher-risk/lower-risk and aggressive/conservative spectrum. Instead, more than half would pick funds that ranged from “growth-focused to stability-focused.” Beyond sounding more positive, these descriptors provide greater context and clarity. In addition to aligning with participants’ desire for investments that are diversified, using the term “portfolio” signaled a collection of investments in a way “fund” and “strategy” did not. When ranking the benefits of both TDFs and TRFs, “fully diversified” was chosen as the most compelling benefit (34%).

Employers today are constantly challenged to not only attract and retain valued employees, but also to reduce their financial stress, all while increasing productivity.  
Many plan sponsors understand that participants are increasingly looking to them to provide the knowledge, tools, and services they need to meet their retirement planning challenges. Most large defined contribution (DC) plan sponsors are working to address this with a focus on helping participants:



Save early, often, and enough for retirement
Select (or default to) appropriate investment options
Better understand the intersection of retirement and health care
Learn how to create a retirement income plan that can last 20 or more years

Today, robust, tailored educational programs must focus on both accumulation (saving) and decumulation (income) topics, take into consideration shifts in demographics and the changing concept of “retirement,” and use language and delivery methods that appeal directly to various generations in various formats. An Education Policy Statement (EPS) can help plan sponsors create — and follow — an education strategy and plan that incorporates this complex, new reality.
The EPS not only clarifies and documents a plan sponsor’s commitment to effective employee education, but provides a detailed execution roadmap. In this article, we detail the six sections of an EPS:

It is no surprise that effective diversification remains one of the most useful tools plan sponsors have to help strengthen potential retirement outcomes for participants. So why do so many participants still remain so poorly diversified?
As of June 30, 2020, the vast majority of US defined contribution (DC) assets were invested in target date funds (30.7%) as well as traditional US equity (33%), stable value (10.2%), and US fixed income (6.9%). Less than 1% was invested in expanded “portfolio diversifier” categories, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), real estate, and alternatives.1 That is in sharp contrast to similar retirement plans abroad, such as Australia’s arguably more developed DC system that, on average, held alternatives allocations of approximately 22% as of June 30, 2020.2
The category covers a wide range of investments, including global infrastructure, real estate, and commodities. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are also frequently included in diversified real assets portfolios, given their link to inflation.
Today, DC plan sponsors can choose from a range of diversified real assets solutions to help offer participants an efficient way to tap into this compelling set of diversifiers — all packaged together in one easy-to-access, professionally managed investment solution.
In this article, we dive into the three compelling investment characteristics – income, diversification, returns – of real assets.

Fiduciaries for defined contribution (DC) plans will soon be required to give lifetime income illustrations to their participants. But what does this entail? Now is the time for plan committees to begin preparing for the illustrations and their likely impact on plans and participants. We provide an overview of the regulation, the important provisions within and six “best practice” considerations.
The 2019 SECURE Act included a mandate for plans to give annual lifetime income illustrations to participants.1 However, the law delayed the requirement until one year  after the DOL issues final guidance about how to calculate the monthly income amounts and about the disclosures to be given to participants.

On Sep. 18, 2020, the DOL published an interim final regulation.2 As a result, the first illustrations must be made for the participant benefit statements for 2021.
Most likely, plans will decide to provide the illustrations for account balances on the Dec. 31, 2021 statements, which will be distributed in early 2022. The purpose is to give participants additional information to help them think about retirement security and the retirement income that can be generated by their plan investments.

What you need to know
As fiduciaries, plan committees will be legally responsible for developing and delivering the illustrations to participants. In most cases though, the work will be done by service providers (e.g., plan recordkeepers). However, plan committee members must make sure the job is done and that it’s done properly. As a result, committee members, and the staff that supports the plan committee, need to understand the requirements.

In addition, committee members should consider the impact of those illustrations on participants and decide if additional services are needed, and if plan operations and investments need to be modified.

For example:

Will participants understand what the projected income means for them?
Will they need additional information about retirement income adequacy and how to reach that goal?
Would it be a good idea to amend the plan to allow retired participants to take monthly withdrawals?
Should the plan’s investment lineup include investments and advisory services that focus on producing retirement income?

Learn more about the lifetime income illustration regulation and what it means for plan sponsors.

 - Offer a suite of risk-based strategies, with the moderate portfolio as their qualified default investment alternative (QDIA), and do not have target date funds.
- Reduced the age for access to their managed account program from 55 to 50 to help participants with a more complex financial picture stay in the plan.

As more and more Boomers reach the age of 65, plan sponsors are under pressure to evolve their plan design, investment menu, and participant engagement efforts. But while the industry is focused on getting ready for the Boomers, we found that millennials and Gen X also want help to plan and prepare for the transition to retirement, perhaps earlier than is expected. Although these participant segments are further from retirement, they want employers to start the income conversation at age 45 or younger. Too often, it begins around age 55 or older, which for many is considered too late.
We found that our study participants want their employers to communicate with them about the transition from accumulating wealth to income generation, especially as it relates to their options within their current plan. In fact, across all ages, 60% of participants would rather achieve “retirement income” versus “retirement savings.” And, while they want the freedom to do what they want, when they want — when it comes to their financial retirement goals, they preferred to achieve realistic “financial security” over the more idealistic “financial freedom.”

How we view and define retirement has undergone a philosophical change. There are multiple factors at play, including longer lifespans, more active lifestyles, supporting or caregiving for family members, lack of traditional pensions, and rising health care costs. These have all added more complexity and disparity to how people live in retirement.
With this new “retire-mentality” comes a seismic shift toward helping defined contribution (DC) plan participants turn their retirement plan savings into a stream of income in retirement that may need to last for 20 or more years. Plan sponsors must re-think how they approach their plan design, investment menu, and communications strategy as participants shift their mindset from retirement savings to retirement income.

Additionally, participants often find their DC plans confusing and wish for clearer language — with less industry jargon — to help them understand their options and make more informed decisions. Plan sponsors can help close the gap of confusion and misunderstanding by carefully selecting words that truly resonate with participants.

Our 2021 DC language study focuses on the impact of language on plan participants’ overall understanding of, and behavior toward, the plan’s investment menu, professionally managed menu options, the potential benefits of staying in the plan post-retirement, and how best to communicate retirement income.

In the Executive Summary, we highlight our key research findings: 

1.     Plainspoken language helped participants more easily understand their investment options.
2.    Simply framing options on the investment menu helped participants choose the right option for their needs.
3.    Participants wanted their employers to communicate with them about the transition from accumulating wealth to income generation.
About the study

Together with Maslansky + Partners, we conducted in-depth interviews with seven plan sponsors and connected with more than 1,607 DC plan participants (large employers with more than 5,000 employees) through online surveys and virtual focus groups across the US and Canada. During these sessions, we tested different versions of messages to uncover what works and why. Participant data and quotes reflect research conducted in the US.

Municipal bonds are securities issued by states, cities, counties, and other governmental entities to fund day-to-day obligations and to finance capital projects such as building schools, highways, and sewer systems. Our “Spotlight on a municipal credit” is designed to provide insight into these investment opportunities by offering a closer look at a particular issuer of municipal bonds.

Fitch:  AA1
Grand Parkway Transportation Corporation is a transportation corporation based in Austin, Texas. The corporation is authorized to act on behalf of the Texas Transportation Commission for the public purpose of developing, financing, operating and maintaining certain segments of the Grand Parkway Project.  When completed, the Grand Parkway Project (State Highway 99), will be a 184-mile outer loop around the greater Houston metro area. The project is intended to improve mobility, reduce congestion, and accommodate demographic and economic growth in the greater Houston area.
Transactions and toll revenues grew nearly 8% and 18%, respectively, in fiscal year 2019 (with August 31, 2019 as its fiscal year-end).1 Through the end of February 2020 (or the first half of fiscal year [FY] 2020), transactions were up 8% and revenues up 10% year over year (YOY).2 However, transactions and revenues declined sharply during Q3 due to COVID-19, with both transactions and toll revenues declining 30% YOY. As result, through the end of the third quarter, transactions are down 6% while revenues are down 5% YOY.
Why we like the credit: Despite recent declines in transactions and revenues, as well as the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we believe the corporation’s bonds (specifically the senior debt) should continue to perform. Assuming a 30% decline in toll revenues in FY20 (a very conservative assumption), we expect debt service coverage to remain in excess of 20 times. To put a 30% decline into perspective, the corporation would have to receive zero toll revenues during Q4 FY 2020 for this to occur, which we believe is unlikely.
While debt service for senior debt jumps from $7 million in FY  2020 to $44 million in FY 2021, even if toll revenues declined an additional 50% in FY 2021, we estimate that debt service coverage would remain in excess of one time. In addition, the corporation has ample liquidity, with just over 2,000 days of cash on hand as of the end of FY 2019.

Key takeaways
Assessing our outlook
We recently reconvened to assess the impacts of the Omicron variant and the Fed’s hawkish pivot on our 2022 outlook.
Has the outlook changed?
Our outlook remains largely intact, with a few notable exceptions.
Does this impact our asset class view?
The two preferences that we thought might be altered by Omicron and the Fed were emerging markets (EM) and longer duration. But we continue to favor both.

At Invesco, constructing our annual outlook is an important endeavor. We begin the process in early September, bringing together some of our most experienced investment professionals and thought leaders, representing different regions and asset classes, to undergo a multi-step process. We first develop gross domestic product projections and inflation projections based on a variety of inputs. We also factor in fiscal and monetary policy in various countries and regions to help form our view. We then determine where in the economic cycle we are, which informs our asset class preferences. To address the breadth of possibilities that lie ahead in the environment, we not only provide a base case scenario that we believe is highly probable, but we also provide two additional tail risk scenarios and contemplate the investment implications of each.
When we released the 2022 outlook in early December, we gave the caveat that we had formed these views largely prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant and the possibility of an accelerated taper timeline from the Federal Reserve. We recognized that there may be a need to revisit the outlook if we were to experience an event significant enough to potentially alter the macroeconomic landscape and investment implications. And so we recently reconvened to assess the impacts of the spread of the Omicron variant and the Fed’s hawkish pivot.
Has the outlook changed?
The result is that our outlook remains largely intact, with a few notable exceptions:

We believe growth will be negatively impacted in the first quarter due to Omicron, but that it would then be made up for later in the year, likely as soon as the second quarter given how fast-moving Omicron is.
We also believe more policy tightening is likely given the Fed’s hawkish pivot. However, we do not believe it will be so excessive as to end the economic cycle; rather, we continue to expect a measured deceleration in growth for the US and other developed countries where fiscal and monetary stimulus is being removed. There is always the risk of a policy error, but it is not our base case.
Also due to Omicron, we expect further supply chain stress as China pursues targeted lockdowns in line with its zero-COVID strategy. This may negatively impact Chinese growth, but not derail it. It’s also likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures, and so higher inflation may last slightly longer than the mid-year peak that we anticipated in our outlook.
Omicron has also increased the possibility of the “persistent inflation” tail risk scenario we shared when we released the outlook, given its potential to exacerbate inflation. However, it is not our base case scenario.

Does this impact our asset class view?
The two asset preferences in our base case scenario that we thought might be altered by the Omicron spread and a more hawkish Fed were emerging markets and longer duration. However, we continue to support both of those preferences:

Emerging markets. Given that our growth expectations for 2022 have only been slightly altered by Omicron, we continue to favor this asset class. Our view is that the re-acceleration in growth for emerging markets could be slightly delayed due to Omicron, but it could actually be more robust as a result of the immunization benefits Omicron could bring. We continue to believe the US dollar will be relatively neutral, which also supports our preference for emerging markets. I also provide the caveat that many idiosyncratic factors drove the performance of EM in 2021 and may well continue to do so in 2022. We will follow up with more specific views on different areas within emerging markets.


Longer duration. In the outlook, we shared our expectation for long rates to remain stable or somewhat down. After robust debate, we re-affirm that view. We expect ongoing pressure for rates to rise in short and intermediate maturities, but we anticipate rates to remain anchored or possibly even lower in the long end, which would likely favor duration. Our rationale for this view is that the overall growth outlook is largely unchanged, besides a shift in growth contributions between the first quarter and the second quarter.  We recognize there is the potential for an alternate scenario in which rates rise on the long end, a view held by the Invesco Fixed Income team, which would cause us to change our view on duration. And so we do provide the caveat that our views may change when we re-convene to deliberate on our mid-year outlook. If we determine there could be a re-acceleration in growth (as we saw in 2005 and 2010), our view on the direction of rates, and therefore our view on duration, would likely change.

Conclusion
Even with the impacts of the Omicron variant, our key hypothesis remains: We expect a convergence of returns across asset classes as economic growth approaches trend growth rates. As we wrote in December, we view 2022 as a year of transition.

Key takeaways
What have we learned?
The FOMC’s December minutes revealed a more hawkish stance than many investors expected to see from the Fed.
What does this mean for stocks?
It’s normal for stocks to experience near-term volatility as an initial response to changing monetary policy, but it’s also typical for stocks to recover and post sound returns through the rest of the cycle.
Where are we in the cycle?
We believe we’re at the mid-point of the cycle, which could ultimately last five years or more.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has released the minutes from its December meeting, revealing a more hawkish stance that impacted the shape of the yield curve and shook up equity sector leadership. Below we answer 10 questions about this news.
1.      What happened?
Participant remarks highlighted that the FOMC has become more concerned about inflation and believes that the economy is closer to full employment than is typically the case at the beginning of the policy normalization process.
2.      Is there new information?
The FOMC had previously telegraphed the onset of the policy tightening cycle. However, the minutes suggested that a faster pace of rate increases than in the previous cycle may be warranted. Further, the FOMC appears eager to reduce the size of its balance sheet. Discussions of quantitative tightening have already commenced, with expectations that it will begin relatively soon after the first rate hike and proceed faster than it had in the prior cycle.
3.      What’s priced in? Did financial conditions change?
The markets are pricing in at least three interest-rate hikes in 2022 with a 75% probability that the first rate hike arrives in March.1 Importantly, financial conditions remain easy.2 The credit markets have behaved3 and there has not been a worrisome strengthening in the US dollar.4
4.      What happened to the shape of the yield curve?
Interest rates have risen across the yield curve. The 2-year US Treasury yield, which was trading between 20 and 30 basis points as recently as September, has climbed by over 13 basis points since the beginning of the year to 0.87% on Jan. 6, 2022.5 The 10-year US Treasury yield has climbed by more than 20 basis points to over 1.70%, returning to the 2021 high reached in late March, prior to the Delta variant arriving in the US.5
5.      What can we expect from bonds based on history?
History suggests that interest rates tend to rise during a tightening cycle, with short rates rising more than long rates. There have been six Fed tightening cycles since 1990. From six months prior to first rate hikes until the end of tightening cycles, the 10- minus 2-year Treasury yield curve has flattened by an average of 90 basis points.6
6.      What happened to the stock market?
In the wake of the incrementally hawkish FOMC minutes, stocks, as represented by the S&P 500 Index, fell over 2% from their all-time high, as of Jan. 5.7
7.      What can we expect from stocks based on history?
If past is prologue, it’s normal for stocks to experience some near-term volatility in response to changing monetary policy.8 Beyond the initial policy shift, however, it’s also typical for stocks to recover and go on to post sound returns through the rest of the cycle (more on that later).8 In our view, stocks should continue to benefit from the same things the Fed is leaning into, namely strong economic and earnings growth.
8.      What happened to sector leadership?
The previously high-flying technology stocks fell over 4% from their year-to-date highs.9 By contrast, deep-value cyclical stocks – financials and energy – are up almost 3% and 7%, respectively.10 Meanwhile, the defensive consumer staples sector has rung in the new year on a mildly positive note.11
9.      What can we expect from sectors based on history?
Our instinct is to default to first principles. Basically, we see the Fed tapping the brakes by guiding interest rates higher and flattening the yield curve to restrain an overheating US economy. In that context, we think it’s too soon to rotate into deep-value cyclicals, which would likely require a steepening yield curve and an economic reacceleration. Absent an economic recession, we also believe the timing is wrong for defensives, which we wouldn’t expect to outperform meaningfully until the end of the current market cycle. In our view, ample yet moderating activity points to the potential for continued outperformance of structurally advantaged growth companies like those in the technology sector.
10.  Where are we in the market cycle and how much longer do we have?
If our back-of-the-envelope math is correct, we think we’re at the mid-point of the cycle, which could ultimately last five years or more. The difference between the 10- and 2-year Treasury bond yield is roughly 0.75%.12 Assuming three rate hikes are priced in this year, that would leave room for three 25 basis-point rate hikes next year. If the Fed sticks to its plan to keep raising rates and ultimately inverts the yield curve in 2024, history suggests an economic recession may not occur for one or two more years after that. Granted, the Fed won’t be on autopilot and will change its plan as it deems necessary. Nonetheless, we foresee sufficient economic momentum to push stocks higher from here, perhaps meaningfully so.

Key takeaways
Markets are worried about rate hikes
There’s so much anxiety about what the Federal Reserve will do this year, given the high level of inflation.
But the Fed has multiple tools at its disposal
From my perspective, markets are overestimating the number of rate hikes that will occur this year.
We’re on the road to normal
We’re seeing multiple signs of normalization that suggest we are getting closer to pre-pandemic conditions. There are just a lot of bumps between here and there.

I remember when my children were young, they were all so afraid of what was under their bed at night. They couldn’t help but let their imaginations run wild, envisioning the worst possible things residing under their bed after dusk — horned and fanged monsters with an appetite for little children, and the occasional garden-variety mass murderer. In the morning, when they got the courage to look under the bed, they would always realize that their fears were worse than the reality of a few dirty socks. And so it is with investors imagining the worst possible scenarios for Federal Reserve (Fed) tightening this year. I suspect reality will be considerably better than their worst fears.
It’s been breathtaking to watch the dramatic change in expectations surrounding the Fed this year. Estimates for rate hikes are all over the place, but they’ve been trending a lot higher in the past couple of weeks — and we’ve seen stocks and other risk assets fall in response. There are whispers that the Fed will end asset purchases at this week’s meeting; others think the Fed could start to raise rates at this week’s meeting. And some are anticipating as many as eight rate hikes this year — that may be worse than the giant eight-legged hairy spider under the bed that wanted to kidnap my daughter and bring her back to its human-sized web.
Let’s face it — there’s so much anxiety about whether the Fed will be forced into getting aggressive because of the level of inflation, and in doing so make a policy error. But from my perspective, markets are overestimating just how much the Fed will tighten this year.
Signs of ‘normal’ ahead
The Fed has three tools it plans to utilize this year to help combat inflation — tapering its asset purchases, raising rates, and reducing the size of its balance sheet. Given the range of tools at its disposal, I feel strongly that there is less pressure on the Fed to rely on its traditional tool — hiking rates — in a dramatic way. That doesn’t mean it won’t try to act quickly; however, acting early doesn’t necessarily mean acting often. In other words, inflationary pressures may impact timing, but as we have learned from past rate hike cycles, it’s not when the Fed begins but where it ends that will have a bigger impact on assets.
It’s understandably unnerving for investors at the start of the tightening season to ponder what could happen this year. I think it’s important to step back and see the bigger picture. In my view, much of what we have seen in recent weeks, some of which is causing unease for investors, signifies that we are on the path to “normal” for the global economy and markets:

We’ve seen a real and significant global stock market sell-off. For the last 22 months, we’ve seen just a few stock sell-offs, mostly shallow, followed by rapid recoveries as market participants quickly piled back into stocks. The behavior we’ve seen over the last few weeks is reminiscent of a more normal market environment, punctuated by a very significant sell-off without an immediate recovery.
“Stay-at-home” stocks have been tanking. Yes, Omicron is still raging in parts of the world, but in other parts it has already peaked. Stocks are clearly discounting a return to something more like a pre-pandemic world with people back to normal routines of gym visits and more entertainment outside the home.
Supply and demand conditions are normalizing. We’re starting to see pent-up demand being burned off and supply improving. For example, the Empire Manufacturing Survey for January revealed a drop in new orders, a drop in unfilled orders and a drop in delivery times.1 In addition, inventories rose. It was recently reported that both China and Vietnam are asking workers not to travel for the Lunar New Year in order to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and therefore try to prevent labor shortages that can exacerbate supply chain issues.2 This should help ease inflationary pressures.
We expect economic growth to improve in China. Fiscal and monetary stimulus should help boost Chinese growth, moving closer to trend, in our view. Corporate earnings appear on track for a good year: Consensus expectations are calling for earnings per share growth of 13% for China for 2022.3

So let’s not fear higher rates — we’re seeing multiple signs of normalization that suggest we are getting closer to pre-pandemic conditions.
Speed bumps to watch for
Having said that, we are also seeing some speed bumps on the path to normal:

Parts of the world are experiencing a big surge in COVID. COVID-19 is still spreading rapidly in parts of the world. And this spread is impacting economic growth, as evidenced in recent flash Purchasing Managers Index readings for the eurozone, Japan and the US.4 We also have to recognize that the spread of the Omicron variant is likely to increase supply chain disruptions, so that should slightly delay the return to normal for prices.
There are fears that Ukraine could be invaded by Russia as early as this week. The ensuing sanctions against Russia could drive up the price of oil, which in turn could add to inflationary pressures in the short run.

So we won’t get back to normal tomorrow. And there are some aspects of the current situation that will be more persistent — such as labor market constraints and wage growth. We’ve been reminded of that in earnings results for the fourth quarter: As of Jan. 14, 60% of S&P 500 Index companies noted the negative impact of labor costs in their earnings calls.5
This inflation picture is what has market participants so worried about what the Fed might do; the monster under the bed gets bigger and uglier every day we continue to see elevated inflation and more sources of inflationary pressure.
What to watch this week
Looking ahead, I will be following these data releases particularly closely:

US PCE Price Index. We always want to pay attention to the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, although I don’t expect any surprises
University of Michigan inflation expectations. This will be an important indicator of whether longer-term consumer inflation expectations remain relatively anchored, a metric that is important to the Fed

And of course, we have some central bank meetings this week, including the Bank of Canada. However, all eyes will be on the Fed. I think Fed Chair Jay Powell will try to “thread the needle” in his press conference, talking tough but providing enough clarity and calm to shine a light on the monster under the bed, and perhaps dispel the worst fears of market participants. However, I don’t believe volatility or sell-offs will end with Powell’s words; I expect them to continue until at least the first rate hike.

Brian Levitt
Global Market Strategist
Key takeaways
Investors have rested easy
A decade of modest growth, benign inflation, and accommodative monetary policy has helped investors sleep at night.
Current conditions have caused tossing and turning
High and rising inflation and policy tightening hasten the end of market and business cycles.
I’m preparing for what comes next
I still favor equities but will be positioned for the slowdown that the Fed is seeking to engineer.

People are always asking me what keeps me up at night. I had never imagined that my circadian rhythms would be of interest to people. However, that’s what people want to know when you spend most of your adult life as a bullish market strategist. Inherent in their questions has been the belief that I had been too Pollyanna about equity markets and that something was lurking around the corner to derail the market. In the 2010s, I had my prepared response of, “not much.” A decade of modest growth, benign inflation, and accommodative monetary policy had me sleeping like Rip Van Winkle. Occasionally I would throw in a joke about having young daughters who kept me up at night but that quickly ceased being an issue. Thanks, Dr. Ferber.
I was able to rest easy armed with the best advice I have ever received in this industry: Don’t fight the Fed. The market could ultimately take all the things that kept most everyone else up at night —elections, government shutdowns, trade wars, regional strife, even pandemics — so long as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) kept policy conditions easy and stood ready to come to the rescue in adverse environments of the economy and financial markets. It became such a powerful force behind markets that it even got a name, “the Fed put.” In short, the Fed had become so proactive in halting excessive market declines that they were seen as insurance against losses, like a put option. 
As such, I evolved my answer over time from “not much” to a less-flippant response of “a prolonged period of high and rising inflation, resulting in meaningful policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve.” It felt like a harmless retort. After all, the structural forces in the economy — aging populations, globalization, automated workforces, personalized medicine — suggested inflation could remain relatively benign for much of the rest of my career, if not my life.
What’s different today?
That is, until a reopening from a pandemic resulted in massive pent-up demand being unleashed on an economy before the inventories were rebuilt and the workers returned. You may suspect now, with inflation at 7%1 and the Fed signaling four interest rate hikes in 20222, that I’m sleeping less restfully. Alas, you would be right. High and rising inflation and policy tightening hasten the end of market and business cycles, plain and simple. As the late Economist Rudi Dornbusch of MIT quipped, none of the market cycles of the second half of 20th Century “died in bed of old age. Every one was murdered by the Federal Reserve.”
Don’t get me wrong. This can still work itself out. Consumers are already balking at higher prices.3 A pending slowdown in demand could go a long way toward fixing those supply-chain challenges. The pandemic could become more endemic (more manageable with greater population immunity) and result in people returning to the labor force. A meaningful moderation in inflation could have the Fed backing off their tightening stance in 2023, and the cycle continuing.  
What I’m doing now
For now, I am determined to not fight the Fed. I’m bracing for heightened market volatility and significantly more modest market returns. Nonetheless I still favor equities but will be positioned for the slowdown that the Fed is seeking to engineer, complete with higher quality, more defensive equity exposure. The way I see it, investing in highly speculative stocks was for last year.
And I’ll watch for signs that the cycle is coming to a premature end. Persistent inflation despite policy tightening. That would be my nightmare.

Gender inequality is a global issue, impacting women and families from Monrovia, Liberia to Brownsville, Texas. The World Bank has stated that “... failure to fully unleash women’s productive potential ... represents a major missed opportunity with significant consequences for individuals, families, and economies.” Resolving the issue will require a multi-pronged approach, including easing many of the barriers that foster an unlevel keep the playing field. Fair access to capital, education, health care, and other resources must be encouraged and supported, and efforts are needed to ease the burdens of family care that have historically disproportionately fallen on the shoulders of women. The following two issues are a good example of bonds that can help promote gender equality.
Issuer: State of Oregon, Housing and Community Services Department
Oregon Housing and Community Services (OHCS) is Oregon’s housing finance agency, providing financial and program support to create and preserve opportunities for high-quality, affordable housing for Oregonians of lower and moderate income. OHCS administers federal and state antipoverty, homeless and energy assistance, and community service programs, financing of single-family homes, new construction or rehabilitation of multifamily affordable housing developments, as well as grants and tax credits to promote affordable housing. Programs overseen by the OHCS have a focus on disadvantaged populations, including the over 40% of single-mother households in Oregon that are below the poverty level. Currently, the director of the OHCS is a female. Additionally, the OHCS is governed by the Oregon State Housing Council, of which four of the seven members are female.
Issuer: International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is the original World Bank institution. The World Bank Group works with partners and clients to advance gender equality and incorporates considerations of gender equality in the analysis, content, and monitoring of all programs and Country Assistance Strategies. Through its programs the IBRD seeks to promote business opportunities for women, provide easier access to capital for women, and support other programs intended to empower women for greater economic success and social mobility. To achieve these goals, the IBRD works with partners such as the Advisory Council on Gender and Development, Gender Equality Community of Practice for Finance Ministers, Commission on the Status of Women, Equal Futures Partnership, Harvard Kennedy School Women in Public Policy Program, Nike Foundation, Oxfam International, Rockefeller Foundation, United Nations Foundation, and UN Women.

Details emerge about the Fed’s path forward
Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee helped shed a little light on what to expect from the Federal Reserve in the coming year.
Balance sheet reduction should be ‘in the background’
Fed Chair Jay Powell made it clear that the federal funds rate will be the primary tool for the Fed, and that shrinking the balance sheet will occur “in the background.”
What’s different this time?
The balance sheet is much bigger, has a shorter duration, economic growth is higher, and inflation is higher than it was during the last reduction in 2014.

For the past several weeks, imaginations have been running wild about what the Federal Reserve will do this year to help tame rising inflation. Last week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) helped shed a little light on what to expect from the Fed in the coming year. Following are a few of the highlights from the FOMC announcement and press conference.
What did we learn from the FOMC?
The Fed does not yet know the path of rate hikes. More specifically, it does not know the pace or size of rate hikes. That’s because the Fed will be data dependent, as it recognizes the importance of being nimble and reacting to the incoming data and the evolving outlook. However, the Fed does believe the economy is very different than it was in 2015 — growth is higher, inflation is higher, and the labor market is in far better shape — and so it can tighten more quickly and more significantly. In last week’s press conference, Fed Chair Jay Powell shared his view that there is “quite a bit of room” to raise rates without threatening the labor market and choking off the economy. Not coincidentally, stocks started tumbling after those words.
The focus is on stable prices. The Fed appears satisfied it has reached its “full employment” mandate. It is focusing on its “stable prices” mandate, as it believes inflation risks have increased. In fact, the most important change in language in the FOMC statement concerned inflation, which is now described as “well above 2 percent” versus the previous “having exceeded 2 percent for some time.” This suggests that rate lift-off will occur “soon.”
No specifics yet on balance sheet reduction. The “Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet” was released along with the Fed’s statement. This document is similar to past communications regarding the balance sheet, such as the principles around normalization that was released in 2014. This document shared broad objectives such as the Fed’s intention to primarily hold Treasury securities in its balance sheet, but gave no real specifics. 
Reductions may start “in the background” this summer. Though we don’t have specifics just yet, the Fed expects to begin reducing its balance sheet soon. It will need to work out the details in the next one or two meetings, and so it could be poised to start quantitative tightening this summer. However, Powell made it clear that the federal funds rate will be the primary tool for the Fed. Shrinking the balance sheet will occur “in the background.”
How might balance sheet reduction be different this time?
We can’t overlook the fact that we only found out recently about the Fed’s plans to begin reducing the balance sheet (also known as quantitative tightening) this year. That balance sheet reduction was discussed at the December FOMC meeting came as a surprise, given that this process began much later in the previous tightening cycle.
We have to take a step back and recognize that not only is the Fed preparing to begin quantitative tightening (QT) much earlier in the normalization process this time, but it is dealing with a very different balance sheet — it is much larger now than it was in 2014, when the Fed ended its asset purchases in response to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). When the Fed ended its quantitative easing (QE) program in 2014, the Fed’s balance sheet stood at approximately $4.5 trillion.1 The Fed waited to begin QT until the fall of 2017, and prematurely ended it in September 2019. The Fed didn’t get very far with its QT back then, only bringing it down to $3.8 trillion. 1 The Fed’s balance sheet has expanded dramatically since then in response to the pandemic and is now at $8.8 trillion – about double the size after GFC QE.1
In fact, Powell was echoing the words of his predecessor, Janet Yellen, when he said last week that balance sheet reduction could occur in the background. Back in 2017, when Janet Yellen was the Chair of the Federal Reserve, she too anticipated balance sheet reduction would occur “in the background.” But in 2016, before QT began, she fretted, “Our ability to predict the effects of changes in the balance sheet on the economy is less than that associated with changes in the federal funds rate.” She worried that “financial markets and the economy could potentially be destabilized if assets were sold too aggressively.”2
The last time around, QT mostly occurred in the background, with an important exception — there was a spike in money-market rates in the third quarter of 2019 that necessitated Fed action. US Treasury debt auctions and corporate tax payments coincided in September 2019, when the Fed’s QT was already reducing bank reserves. The combination of these three factors caused a liquidity shortage as banks scrambled to borrow overnight money to cover their funding needs. (The good news is that the Fed’s standing repo facility launched last year should help ease such frictions and allow for smoother QT this time around, reducing the risk of a tightening in money markets that might spill over into the wider financial markets.) Back in 2019, the Fed stepped in to meet short-term liquidity needs, and in terms of the impact on equities, balance sheet reduction did occur “in the background,” despite fears to the contrary.
The Fed started QT at the end of September 2017 and signaled it would end QT on Aug. 1, 2019, with the effective end date of purchases on that same day. So for that period from Sept. 29, 2017, to Aug. 1, 2019, global stocks were positive: The MSCI World Index rose 8.63% in terms of price appreciation over that time frame, while the S&P 500 Index rose 17.23% in terms of price appreciation.3
This time around the balance sheet is much bigger, has a shorter duration, economic growth is higher, and inflation is higher — and so at last week’s press conference, Powell suggested the Fed could move harder and faster. Which begs the question, “Can balance sheet reduction still occur in the background?”
I would like to think it can, given our experience during the last QT round. I am most comforted by knowing that the Fed is committed to being data dependent, which suggests to me that it should be comfortable adjusting its monthly asset reductions depending on incoming data and financial market stability. However, we will want to follow the situation closely.

Key takeaways
Market cycles
Emerging market (EM) underperformance has entered a late stage, but potential opportunities have begun to present themselves across the region.
Monetary policy
Financial conditions have been restrictive but may become less so for EM stocks.
Economic growth
EM activity has slowed, but global growth remains robust.

As we head into the new year, I believe a fair assessment of an array of forces suggests a mixed outlook for Chinese and EM stocks. However, EM stocks have been so deeply underowned and out of favor that I worry about being too pessimistic. For one, ongoing improvement in Chinese financial conditions could brighten the outlook.
Moreover, it seems the coronavirus has generally had a diminishing impact on the global economy, the wild card being the scope and duration of possible lockdowns. If concerns about the Omicron variant fade sooner than later, the US dollar could soften and investor risk appetite may firm, adding further upside potential to my sober view.
Where are we in the market cycle?
EM stocks have underperformed their developed market (DM) counterparts for more than 11 years, so the trend isn’t our friend.1 From my lens, we remain in the later stages of EM underperformance.
True, EM stocks – capturing corporate performance in the developing countries (e.g., China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Russia) – outperformed significantly in 2016, 2017, and 2020.1
In 2018 and 2019, however, trade wars, an associated shift in investor sentiment, outflows, and currency fluctuations caused EM equities to deviate far below levels justified by generally stable economic fundamentals, in my view.
Also, Chinese policymakers slammed the brakes in early 2021 to rein in the froth and excess they thought was developing. As a result, Chinese stocks lagged their US counterparts last year, alongside slowing money growth.
As shown in Figure 1, Chinese and US stocks have been exceptional under and outperformers, respectively. Excluding those dominant outliers, however, EM stocks have actually been holding their own relative to DM stocks. In fact, Russian, Indian, and Taiwanese stocks, to name a few, have outperformed the global average year to date (Figure 1 below, and Page 6 of the Equity Strategy Playbook).

Some say it’s 2015
Back then, the first Fed rate hike was in the offing following an accommodative period, just like today. But the analogy doesn’t hold up in regard to inflation.
Maybe it’s 1994
At that time, the economy was emerging from a recession and the Fed surprised the market with several rate hikes. But again, the inflation story is different today.
What about 1946?
Comparing 2022 to the second half of the 1940s, while not a perfect analogy, feels like an apt one to me, and certainly looks promising on the inflation front.

In my last post, I responded to the most common question clients ask me: What keeps me up at night?  A close second inquiry is, “what year is this?” I’ve attempted different iterations of a dumb joke about it depending on whether we use the Gregorian calendar or the Chinese calendar or the Assyrian calendar, but as my daughters will attest, I’m not funny. The thing is, everyone is trying to determine the historical equivalent to our current environment, and then allocate their portfolios appropriately. Unfortunately, no two cycles are exactly alike.  
2015: Anticipating a rate hike
Some say it’s 2015. Today, just like then, the first Federal Reserve interest rate hike is in the offing following a period of overly accommodative policy. Those who take this view also take solace knowing that the S&P 500 Index returned 75% from the date of the first rate through the end of 2019.1
Perhaps, but inflation averaged just 1.6% on a year-over-year basis from 2014 to 2019.2 If you look back to the December 2015 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, you’ll see that many members were very skeptical about raising rates in a low inflation environment. By early 2016, they had backed off their tightening stance. 
Is that the right analogy to today? With inflation currently at 7%,3 the most “dovish” of the FOMC members sounding a hawkish tone, and the market pricing in five interest rate hikes this year alone?4 Adele might be back again, the New York Giants are still bad, and I still can’t tell if that dress is blue and brown or white and gold, but other than that the 2015 analogy may not be the right one.
1994: Emerging from a recession
Maybe then it’s 1994. Back then, the economy was emerging from a recession. The Fed surprised the market by initiating seven interest rate hikes within a 12-month period. The 10-year US Treasury rate moved meaningfully higher. Stocks were volatile, experiencing multiple drawdowns throughout the year, including a 9% peak to trough drawdown in the first quarter.5 In the end, the S&P 500 Index finished the year negative on a price return basis and up only 1.31% on a total return basis.6 Nonetheless, from that point until the end of the cycle in 1999, the S&P 500 Index returned 250% on a cumulative basis.7 Again, the inherent message is to be comforted by the similarities. 
However, in 1994, inflation was generally lower than it had been in years. Today, it’s meaningfully higher than it has been in years. Additionally, the unemployment rate stood at 6.6% at the start of 1994, 1.7 times higher than it is today.8 So, five years from now, will we be partying like it’s 1999? One can hope, but it’s way too soon to say.
1946: Working through inflation
Unlike the tightening cycles of our relatively recent past, this time we will be anxiously assessing whether supply chain challenges ease and workers return to the labor force en masse, resulting in a meaningful decline in inflation expectations and a Fed that backs off its tightening stance ala 1995 and 2016. Come to think of it, maybe in some ways it is late 1946 — in that year, inflation spiked as Americans returned from war and unleashed pent-up demand on the economy. In the period that followed, factories, which had been repurposed to support the war effort, rushed to rebuild inventories. Labor participation climbed. Tighter policy slowed the economy meaningfully. Inflation fell precipitously. 
The analogy to the second half of the 1940s, while not perfect, feels like an apt one to me, and certainly looks promising on the inflation front. Will inflation expectations fall fast enough to allow the Fed to back off its tightening stance and extend the cycle? And can we get it through without the mild recession experienced in 1948? 
My instinct says yes. Time will tell.

As responsible stewards of capital, we must contemplate the downside risks for stocks. Sometimes, however, I think we spend too much time worrying and not enough time considering the upside potential. On that score, technical analysis can assist with timing decisions near turning points in any asset, and just such a tactical opportunity may have presented itself in US large-cap stocks.
Where’s the opportunity?
One of my favorite technical indicators – the percentage of S&P 500 Index industry groups above their respective 50-day moving averages – fell to 8% last week, the lowest reading in over a year.1
In other words, US large-cap stocks have become as oversold as they were in late 2020, a condition that was followed by a year of gains in share prices.2 As a result, I’m inclined to interpret the recent shakeout as a temporary risk-shedding event, as opposed to a sinister change of trend. For now, I continue to treat such short-term pullbacks as buying opportunities for stocks, which remain supported by earnings.

Key takeaways
Inflation concerns are spreading
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has turned decidedly hawkish, admitting that inflation is higher and more persistent than expected.
Central banks are taking action
Last week also saw the Bank of England raise rates by 25 basis points again, following a 25 basis point rate hike in December.
We’re anticipating more data
I expect more volatility as market participants assess what various data releases mean for central bank actions.

There was a gasp heard around the world last week, prompted by the words of Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank. At the ECB’s press conference last week, Lagarde turned decidedly hawkish, admitting that inflation is higher and more persistent than expected, with risks now leaning to the upside. While Lagarde insisted that rate hike liftoff was still unlikely to occur in 2022, it appears markets are expecting it to begin in mid-2022.
The ECB is clearly getting concerned about inflation, just as the Federal Reserve has been. And with some good reason: A flash estimate for January euro area inflation clocked in at a 5.1% annualized rate.1 What a difference a year – and a pandemic re-opening – makes: As of a year ago, in January 2021, euro area inflation was rising at a 0.9% annualized rate.1
Last week also saw the Bank of England raise rates by 25 basis points again, following a 25 basis point rate hike in December. Also gasp-worthy was the revelation that four of the nine members of the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee actually wanted to raise rates by 50 basis points. Worries about inflation are spreading among central bankers like a bad case of poison ivy at summer camp.
Meanwhile, the double-gasp-worthy January US jobs report, released on Friday, helped support the view that the Fed will likely act quickly to tighten monetary policy. Not only was nonfarm payroll growth strong (for January as well as in terms of revisions to December) but wage growth was high – and, more importantly, higher than expected. This report bolstered the perception that the Fed will hike rates in March – and even increased the possibility of a 50 basis point hike for liftoff.
How did markets react?
The global bond market reacted emphatically to last week’s events. The yield on the 10-year German bund rose to 0.20% – its highest level in years.2 The yield on the 10-year Italian bond also rose significantly during the week. And so did the 10-year US Treasury yield, which rose above 1.9% last week. 2 In response to the rise in US and European bond yields, the 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose to nearly 0.2% – for the first time since January 2016 – although the Bank of Japan is clearly nowhere near tightening mode. 2
What may happen next?
The BOE, the Fed, the ECB, and the Bank of Canada are all in different places on the path to normalizing monetary policy, but the commonality they share is that they have all turned more hawkish in the last several months. So where do we go from here?
First of all, I expect to hear more hawkish talk from them. Central bankers rely on their words to do some of the heavy lifting, and to a certain extent it has worked thus far. In terms of actual tightening, the pace for these four central banks will largely be dictated by the data – inflation and inflation expectations, that is. For some central banks, there remain concerns about the vulnerability of their respective economies, so I anticipate the ECB and the Bank of Canada will be more sensitive to that.
It is important to recognize that, while the balance of the data has been stronger than expected (pointing to higher inflation) and central bank policy signals in the West are more hawkish than expected (pointing to tighter monetary policy), the situation is more nuanced and country-specific.
For example, the US jobs report showed that workers may be starting to come off the sidelines to take part in the strong economic recovery, enticed by lots of job openings and higher wages and salaries on offer – reflected in average hourly earnings, the labor participation ratio, and the employment-to-population ratio. If workers continue coming back into the labor force, that could give the economic recovery longer legs, and help take some pressure off wage growth.
Europe – both the eurozone (EZ) and UK – also is experiencing a bit of a renaissance in its jobs market. Unemployment tends to be much stickier in the EZ than the UK, and even more so than in the US, because it’s harder to add or reduce workers for most firms. The consensus has been that the ECB won’t be able to do, or need to do, as much tightening as the Fed – mainly for this reason. But if the EZ labor market continues to tighten with falling unemployment, markets may reassess how much more ECB hawkishness to price in.
The BOE, on the other hand, sent mixed messages on future policy. BOE Governor Andrew Bailey called for wage restraint to avoid further inflation pressures, noting that real disposable incomes – the “take home pay” after inflation – will suffer. He was at pains to argue that the market shouldn’t extrapolate from this more BOE rate hikes – even though the 5-to-4 vote for a 25 basis point rate hike instead of a 50 basis point hike was much more hawkish than expected.
While the Fed, BOE and ECB have taken most of the limelight, the Bank of Canada shouldn’t be left outside investors’ radar. BOC Governor Tiff Macklem has indicated that inflation will remain uncomfortably high in the first half of the year, but it’s expected to fall significantly in the back half of the year. Acknowledging the uncertainties created by the pandemic, by supply-chain and labor market issues, he still signaled a series of rate hikes ahead.
Whatever one’s view of the causes of this inflation – excessively loose monetary policy, outsized fiscal support, or pandemic-driven change in the economy – it’s clear that inflation is a bigger, longer-lasting concern than most central banks had hoped. And they’re reacting by pivoting to a more hawkish stance, although that means different things to different central banks.
I expect more volatility as market participants assess what various data releases mean for central bank actions, as well as “central bank speak” (which admittedly can be at times more difficult to decipher than ancient Greek). And I would expect a tailwind for equities in countries where monetary policy is getting closer to the end of tightening or, even better, becoming more accommodative. I think it’s no coincidence that Chinese equities showed strength in recent days, as the People’s Bank of China has been getting more dovish this year.3
What to watch this week
Looking ahead, the week will be rather US-centric and inflation-centric. I expect central bank whisperers to be particularly interested in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), Michigan Inflation Expectations, the Fed’s Monetary Policy Report (submitted in advance of Chair Jay Powell’s semi-annual testimony to Congress), and various speeches from ECB officials.
I can only hope for a “no gasp” week in terms of the data. US CPI is expected to be significantly hotter than the previous month, so I don’t expect any real rattling of markets unless it comes in above expectations. Regular readers of this blog may recall that we don’t anticipate inflation will peak until the middle of 2022, so we would not get flustered by a 7.3% year-over-year rise in inflation — which is the consensus expectation for the CPI. What could be more important are the preliminary Michigan Inflation Expectations for February. The New York Fed’s inflation expectations for the next one and three years remained high in December, but appear to have peaked; we would want to see the same from the Michigan data (we will have to wait until next Monday for January inflation expectations from the NY Fed.) And there are always interesting insights to be found in the Fed’s Monetary Policy Report.
Of course, equity and bond prices have been gyrating as policy expectations are recalibrated for the hawkish turns of central bankers. Our attention remains on just how far the Fed and other central banks feel they must adjust to match the new realities of inflation—and therefore how much longer we expect policy to dominate the market narrative. Until we see inflation abate, or at least inflation expectations indicating they are better anchored, we’re likely not through the woods yet.

Key takeaways
“Fedspeak” rattles markets
Imaginations ran wild last week about how much tightening the Federal Reserve would do in 2022.
Geopolitical tensions build
The pressure increased when the White House announced that a Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared to be imminent.
Falling COVID cases offer hope
There is one factor that could potentially help ease many of the inflationary pressures facing the global economy: winning the battle against COVID.

There’s a Billy Joel song from the 1980s that seems to capture last week rather well. It’s simply called “Pressure” and the rhythm is, well, rather frenetic and oppressive. Every few seconds, he yells the word “Pressure!” loudly – apparently that’s the simple chorus of the song. Let’s put it this way: I don’t recommend listening to this song while trying to meditate or simply de-compress. Needless to say, the song played as background music in my head all last week.
Inflationary pressure
Last week we got the long-awaited US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print for January. The expectation for year-over-year headline CPI was 7.3%, but the number exceeded expectations at 7.5%.1 As I wrote last week, I believe markets could have tolerated a 7-handle inflation print – so long as it was in line with expectations. But the January number exceeded expectations, sending US stocks hurtling downward in the pre-market. Headlines such as “worst inflation reading in 40 years” did not help matters.
Shortly after the initial plunge, stocks showed surprising resilience, brushing off the inflation data and rebounding within minutes of the market opening. But this was to be short-lived – within hours, “Fedspeak” sent stocks downward once again and the 10-year US Treasury yield climbed higher. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard shared his view that, in light of higher inflation, the Fed would need to become more aggressive than previously expected. He elaborated, “I’d like to see 100 basis points in the bag by July 1.”2 Those doing the math realized that, with three meetings before July 1, that meant a 50 basis point hike would need to happen at some point in the second quarter of 2022. Not surprisingly, expectations of a 50 basis point rate hike in March ratcheted up. Adding to anxiety was the fact that Bullard would not completely rule out an “emergency” rate hike in between regularly scheduled Fed meetings. The “gasps” that I had hoped we would avoid when I wrote my blog last week proved unavoidable.
Not surprisingly, this Fedspeak was too much for markets to bear, as imaginations ran wild about how much tightening the Fed would do for the full calendar year 2022. And so US stocks sank in Thursday afternoon trading, and European stocks followed on Friday. Driving “risk off” sentiment was the understanding that Fed tightening can’t solve for a lot of the factors driving inflationary pressures, but it can potentially put an end to the economic cycle.
Geopolitical pressure
Things only got worse on Friday afternoon US time, when the White House announced that a Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared to be imminent. Most geopolitical issues have little impact on markets beyond creating very short-term volatility, but this could be different simply because of the potential impact on the price of commodities at a time when inflation is driving central bank actions.
Conventional wisdom suggests that the US and allies would not engage in a ground war if Russia invades Ukraine, but instead would impose crippling economic sanctions on Russia, and we subscribe to that base case. The good news is that war is likely to be averted. The bad news is that Russia is a major producer of oil and other commodities, and so economic sanctions are likely to drive up prices at a time when the last thing the US or other developed countries need is more inflationary pressures. Most directly affected would be the European Union given its heavy reliance on Russian energy products, but it would drive up energy prices elsewhere as well.
In addition, Russia and Ukraine are major wheat exporters and Ukraine is a major corn exporter (Ukraine has long been nicknamed “the breadbasket of Europe”), so food prices could be driven higher as well. Russia is also the world’s largest exporter of palladium, so there is the potential for more auto supply chain disruptions given that palladium is used in catalytic converters. And that would only add to auto supply chain disruptions that don’t appear likely to abate any time soon, given Toyota and Honda’s recent guidance that the semiconductor shortage in the auto industry doesn’t seem to be ending soon.
And don’t forget the “Freedom Convoy” protestors and blockade on the US-Canada border at the Ambassador Bridge, adding to supply chain disruptions and potentially increasing costs. While the Ambassador Bridge reportedly re-opened yesterday, the demonstrations are far from over. In fact, the movement  has gone global and is popping up in other developed countries such as Belgium and France.
In other words, geopolitical events could add significant fuel to the inflationary pressures that central banks can’t really solve for but might damage their respective economies trying.
Falling COVID cases represent a bright spot
There is one factor that could help ease many of the inflationary pressures facing the global economy: winning the battle against COVID. As infections go down, economies can resume normal functioning, employees can return to work, supply chains can un-kink, and spending can rotate toward services and away from goods.
The World Health Organization announced last week that COVID-19 cases fell 17% worldwide versus the previous week, including a 50% decrease in the United States.3 As I had hoped, the Omicron variant has crowded out the far more dangerous Delta variant – Omicron now comprises most COVID cases around the world. In Germany, Omicron represents 92.53% of COVID cases while in Japan, Omicron represents 95.31% of cases. In Brazil, the United States and the United Kingdom, Omicron currently represents more than 99% of cases.4 Knock on wood, but the future looks bright when it comes to COVID, and I believe that should be far more powerful in combating inflation than anything central banks can do.
What to watch this week
Looking ahead, we will be following a number of releases this week that relate to inflation and central bank action:

From the central banks: European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard are scheduled to speak on Feb. 14. We will also see the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s January meeting, giving us a look into the committee’s thought process.
In terms of inflation:

o   US Producer Price Index
o   UK Consumer Price Index
o   Canada Consumer Price Index
Hot off the presses
As I was writing this blog today, we got a positive data release from the New York Fed — the Survey of Consumer Expectations. It revealed that while inflation expectations remain very elevated, they appear to have peaked (despite all the scary headlines). Median one-year-ahead expected inflation was 5.8% in January after a peak of 6% in both November and December.5 The improvement in three-year-ahead inflation expectations was even more pronounced, dropping to 3.5% in January from 4% in December (the three-year reading peaked at 4.2% in September and October).5

Real estate debt provides a differentiated exposure to many of the positive attributes available to real estate equity investors via a more risk-averse position in the capital stack.
Investors are focused on mitigating their RBC risks
Life insurers can maintain or even reduce their RBC requirements by allocating to real estate debt while increasing expected returns.

While historically equity was the most common way investors sought to access the real estate asset class, debt has grown to play an equally important role. Real estate debt provides a differentiated exposure to many of the positive attributes also available to real estate equity investors via a more risk-averse position in the capital stack. The private real estate debt market is large and the emergence of high-quality debt funds has provided a broad cross section of investors with greater opportunity to access the sector.

Key takeaways
Rising rates are on the horizon
Federal Reserve policymakers are widely expected to raise interest rates three to four times this year.
Fixed income investors should consider the risks
Rising interest rates can have just as harmful an impact on fixed income portfolios as credit risk.
Senior loans may help
Senior loans pay interest based on floating rates, which may be beneficial in a rising rate environment.

Investors today are faced with two significant challenges in fixed income:


How to protect against interest rate risk
Where to find yield.

In this piece, we will discuss how senior loans may offer a strong solution to each of these challenges. 


Rising interest rates
When investing in fixed income, investors must consider both credit risk and interest rate risk. Rising interest rates can have just as harmful an impact on fixed income portfolios as credit risk. Investing for income while not losing principal in a rising rate environment can be challenging, but senior loans may help fixed income investors achieve their investment objectives in a wide variety of market conditions. That is especially true in a rising rate environment because of their high relative yields and limited exposure to interest rate risk due to their short duration.
Federal Reserve (the Fed) policymakers are widely expected to raise interest rates three to four times this year, starting as early as March. The Invesco Global Senior Loan team believes investors should consider repositioning their fixed income portfolios to better prepare for rising rates. Structurally, senior loans pay interest based on floating rates, so loans have significantly much less duration (or interest rate risk) than many fixed income categories.

A review of midstream equities and interest rates
Historically, midstream equities have outperformed other yielding equity sectors during periods of rising interest rates.
With inflation running high, investor anxiety over the potential impact of rising interest rates has begun to intensify. For midstream companies in particular, investors often wonder if the sector’s relatively high distribution or dividend yields tend to help or hurt performance during periods of rising rates. In summary, while there have been short-term periods of weakness in response to dramatic rate moves, we find that over long-term periods, midstream equities, specifically MLPs, have not demonstrated meaningful correlation to interest-rate changes.
Over the past fifteen years, there have now been six periods over which interest rates have increased by at least 100 basis points (bps):
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the yield on the 10-year U.S Treasury increased by 190 bps. Over this period, MLP equities, as measured by the AMZ index, appreciated 29% while utilities1 and real estate investment trusts (REITs)2 declined 5% and 3%, respectively.3 Utilities and REITs are often cited as yielding equity-sector comparisons.

From late 2010 to February 2011, the 10-year yield increased by 134 bps. Over this period, the AMZ appreciated 8% while utilities and REITs increased 3% and 8%, respectively.3
From June 2012 until September 2013, the 10-year yield increased by 154 bps. Over this period, the AMZ appreciated 10% while utilities and REITs each fell 2%.3
From July 2016 through the end of January 2017, the 10-yearyield increased by 123 bps. Over this period, the AMZ declined 3% while utilities and REITs declined by 8% and 9%, respectively.3
From September 2017 through October 2018 the 10-year yield increased by 118 bps. Over this period, the AMZ declined 1% while utilities and REITs declined 1% and 5%, respectively.3
And finally, from August 2020 to March 2021 the 10-year yield increased 122 basis points while the AMZ was up 27% while utilities rose 6% and REITs increased 15%.3

Plan fiduciaries have a duty to select and monitor managed account providers.
Understand related fees
Understand related fees, including an opt-in versus a default approach.

Offering a managed accounts (“MA”) service as part of your DC plan may be an effective investment advice feature for your plan participants and a way to address the growing need for more individualized asset allocations – both to and through retirement.
MA providers are investment managers under ERISA section 3(38) and offer independent, third-party advice geared toward more “do-it-for-me” investors. Accordingly, more than one quarter (28%) of all DC plan sponsors offer a managed account, with higher adoption (44%) among larger plans with at least $250 million in assets.1 Managed accounts can also meet the criteria for a qualified default investment alternative (QDIA), as an alternative to target date funds. Among plans with a QDIA, 9.5% use an MA as the default option.2
Once an MA provider is selected, plan fiduciaries have a duty to monitor the provider (annual is ideal) for quality assurance processes, reasonableness of fees, qualifications of individuals delivering verbal advice, and participant satisfaction/engagement, among other criteria. Here are some helpful tips to evaluate and monitor your MA provider.
1. Advice or guidance: Advice is provided under the fiduciary rules, but guidance is merely an asset allocation recommendation (not actual investment advice). Since advice is a fiduciary function; it is often preferable that the MA provider’s process to deliver the advice be favorably tested against participant complaints or even litigation. Favorable outcomes for the MA provider can provide added peace-of-mind to plan sponsors.
2. Due diligence to hire/monitor: Hiring and monitoring an MA provider is a fiduciary function. It’s important to conduct a due diligence Request for Proposal (RFP) and evaluate a few MA providers for comparison, especially if your recordkeeper only offers one solution – you may be inclined to simply accept the MA offering “as is” without further due diligence. And given the increased focus on cybersecurity, it’s important to assess a providers’ cyber/fraud policies and procedures for mitigating risk. 
3. Advice methodology: There are a few key areas where you may see differences among MA providers, so ask questions when evaluating their services. When evaluating an MA provider, fiduciaries should have a basic understanding of the underlying capital markets assumptions used and how it impacts participant portfolios.

As of December 2019, there were more than 2,000 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with nearly $4.4 trillion in total assets.Those figures represent a staggering 270% increase in the number of funds and more than a 550% growth in assets from just a decade earlier.1 This surging popularity is certainly understandable considering that ETFs may offer many of the key benefits of mutual funds (broad diversification, professional investment management,2 and industry- or sector-focused strategies) combined with the flexible trading of stocks to help deliver a relatively low-cost, tax-efficient investment vehicle.
But how do you narrow down such a large universe to a few ETFs that will best meet your particular needs? And how do you ultimately decide between two or three nearly identical funds?
Start with the basics
Many of us tend to focus on performance and cost when we assess any potential investments. With ETFs, however, these differences may be less pronounced. Because ETFs are specifically designed to closely mirror and track the performance of an underlying index, performance and expense ratio variances between funds tracking the same index might not be sufficient to make an informed choice. As a result, ETF investors may want to examine other potential differentiators – factors like liquidity, transparency, fund size, and index methodology – to help identify an appropriate investment.

Key takeaways
US stocks
Fortunately, the US stock market generally did better during Federal Reserve (Fed) tightening cycles than during Fed easing cycles.
Positioning
After their recent correction, I expect US large-cap growth stocks to resurface, given tighter fiscal and monetary policy coupled with slower activity.
Sectors
US cyclical sectors outperformed their defensive counterparts in four of the last six Fed tightening cycles. I believe persistent defensive sector outperformance likely awaits an economic downturn.

The Fed’s hawkish pivot is on many investors’ minds, and with good reason. I answer these top questions from clients about stock market performance during Federal Reserve (Fed) tightening cycles.
How did US stocks perform in past Fed tightening cycles?
Contrary to popular belief, US stocks generally did better during Fed tightening cycles than during Fed easing cycles. That’s because Fed tightening occurred in the second half of US business cycles 67% of the time, and Fed easing overlapped with US economic recessions 67% of the time.1
See Figure 1 below and Slide 4 in my chartbook Seven reasons to favor stocks in Fed tightening cycles.
What does this mean for investors? It would be unusual for the stock market advance to end this early in a Fed tightening cycle. In my view, the last hike matters more than the first. Until then, I remain a buyer of stocks on the dips.

What women want
We’ve consistently found that employees often find their retirement plans confusing and wish for clearer language, with less industry jargon. Not surprisingly, women and men differ in the language and approach they prefer from their DC plan. In our 2021 DC language study, we found that women tend to be more thoughtful investors, placing a higher value on protecting their retirement savings, preferring target risk funds over target date funds, with a desire for more proactive communications overall.

For most women, risk = loss
When talking about investment risk, women and men hear the term quite differently. When asked what they wanted an investment to do for them, both men and women preferred the more positive investment goal of “maximize my gains.” But when asked in a different way, more women were less likely to take on additional risk for the potential reward, placing a higher value on protecting their assets. While “minimizing my losses” and “protecting my assets” may seem like the same thing, the slight language change can make all the difference when communicating with female participants.

MLP market overview
Midstream MLPs, as measured by the Alerian MLP Index (AMZ), ended January up 10.1% on a price basis and 11.1% higher after distributions are considered. The AMZ outperformed the S&P 500 Index’s 5.2% loss for the month. The best performing midstream subsector for January was the Diversified group, while the Natural Gas Pipeline subsector underperformed, on average.
MLP yield spreads, as measured by the AMZ yield relative to the 10-year US Treasury bond, narrowed by 65 basis points (bps) over the month, exiting the period at 579 bps. This compares to the trailing five-year average spread of 702 bps and the average spread since 2000 of approximately 432 bps. The AMZ indicated distribution yield at month-end was 7.6%.

Future increases to the distribution level will be evaluated quarterly with the ultimate goal of returning distributions to the previous level of $0.305 per quarter, or $1.22 on an annual basis, while balancing the partnership’s leverage target, growth opportunities, and unit buy-backs.

R. Scott Dennis
Chief Executive Officer, Invesco Real Estate
Key takeaways
How we consume goods and services has fundamentally shifted over time
Based on Invesco Real Estate’s CLIC framework – Consume, Live, Innovate and Connect – opportunities to invest in industrial real estate have accelerated thanks to consumer preferences.
COVID has fast-tracked this shift that was long in the making
The pressure on traditional retail has been going on for a decade or more, driven by changes in the way we consume goods and services.
The demand for industrial real estate has benefitted from this shift
Invesco Real Estate examines four main drivers of industrial demand over the next five years.

“The pandemic has devastated retail real estate.” That storyline has been unavoidable over the last year and a half, perpetuated by economic lockdowns and the acceleration of e-commerce. But that’s not the whole story.
For one thing, the pressure on traditional retail has been going on for a decade or more, driven by changes in the way consumers consume goods and services — and there was a significant retail impact for at least 12 months before the pandemic. COVID simply accelerated a fundamental shift that was long in the making.
Importantly, the flip side of this story is industrial, which has benefitted from these existing trends and where we see continued promise in the years to come.
Four drivers of industrial demand
We see four main drivers of industrial demand over the next five years:

The cyclical recovery. Job growth remains the primary driver of industrial demand.
Expansion of e-commerce. The continuing shift to e-commerce remains a significant near- to mid-term demand driver.
“Just in case” inventory. Supply-chain disruptions have prompted some companies to hold more inventory (a “just in case” versus “just in time” strategy).
Onshoring/nearshoring. The need for a more resilient supply chain has led to a reshuffling of resources.

Driver 1: The cyclical recovery
As the chart below shows, the demand for industrial space has a higher historical correlation with job growth than with other macroeconomic drivers such as gross domestic product (GDP)1, retail sales, or business inventories.
The obvious exception is 2020, when job growth plunged, but industrial demand grew year-over-year (Y/Y) from 2019. Does this represent a reset in what’s important to the industrial market going forward? No—we believe this is an outlier driven by strong e-commerce demand during the pandemic. We expect industrial demand to remain highly correlated to the business cycle.

Multiple ways to access digital assets
As the space has grown, investors now have more ways to access digital assets.
ETFs provide an efficient way to invest
ETFs can provide investors with exposure to different aspects of the digital asset ecosystem, all through well-known vehicles that are efficient to own and trade.
New ETFs available
We have launched two new digital assets ETFs in partnership with Galaxy Fund Management and Alerian.

Headlined by cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin) and blockchain, digital assets are quickly becoming a major investable asset class. Cryptocurrencies alone have a collective market capitalization of $2.1 trillion—nearly equal to the amount of all U.S. dollars in circulation.1
So, it’s not surprising that many investors are exploring the value that digital assets may add to their portfolios. The idea of choosing from an ever-growing list of cryptocurrencies and navigating the potential risks associated with them may seem daunting. But the ways investors can access digital assets are expanding rapidly, and Invesco is at the forefront of this effort with the launch of our new Digital Asset ETFs, seeking to make it easier for investors to access this growing space.

Investing in digital assets: Three key questions to guide your journey
Here are three of the most common questions we hear investors asking as they begin exploring digital assets: 
1. Why are people interested in adding digital assets to their portfolios? 
Potential opportunity: In addition to being a large, growing asset class, digital assets are a transformative force shaping economic activity. Well-known companies, such as Tesla and PayPal2, and governments throughout the world continue to explore the benefits of leveraging cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to improve their operations. That’s one important way many investors believe that digital assets can play a role in diversified portfolios as adoption may grow. In fact, 90% of institutional investors surveyed recently believe that their own portfolios or their clients' portfolios would include digital assets in the next five years, according to Fidelity.3

Kristina Hooper
Chief Global Market Strategist, Invesco
Key takeaways
How will the crisis impact inflation?
We expected significant upward pressure on the prices of oil, natural gas, wheat, corn, palladium, aluminum, and other metals.
Could freezing Russia from SWIFT hurt markets?
It is important to note that the exclusions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications impact specific banks, and energy exports are apparently carved out from these sanctions.
How might sanctions impact Russia’s economy?
We expect dramatic pressure on the Russian financial system and economy, comparable to a major financial crisis.

As fighting continued in Ukraine over the weekend, a long list of countries implemented a long list of economic sanctions against Russia. Questions are pouring in about what this all means for markets, for inflation, and for the global economy. Below, we address the most common questions given what we know at the moment.
How will the Russia-Ukraine crisis impact inflation?
As was mentioned in a previous blog, we expected a significant upward pressure on the prices of a number of commodities, including oil, natural gas, wheat, corn, palladium, aluminum, and other metals. The Russia-Ukraine war has already caused a sharp price shock in energy, grains, and metals. Now, sanctions on Russia raise risks of even higher prices and possible interruptions in the supply of many commodities. Energy is at the epicenter of the impact.
While energy has only an approximate 7.5% weighting within the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), it has an impact on many other items, as it is a cost component of a wide variety of goods and services.1 For example, the price of oil is a cost component of takeout food (home delivery costs) and home appliances (transportation costs). Energy prices (such as electricity) even factor into the cost of operating a factory, increasing the cost of items produced in that factory. It is difficult to assess the precise impact on CPI, but we have observed a positive correlation between US oil prices and US CPI. In other words, we expect this crisis to add to inflationary pressures. However, we still expect to see inflation peak around the middle of the year and then start to moderate as other inflationary pressures recede. The bad news/good news is that consumer sentiment is weakening meaningfully, and inflation-adjusted wages are falling, which causes us to anticipate reduced demand for goods and services — this would help alleviate inflationary pressures.
How is this affecting bond markets?
US credit spreads are still tight and could remain that way.2 Not surprisingly, the Russian bond market was hit hard. Investors flocked to “safe haven” bonds such as US Treasuries. Developed world bond markets have continued to price in a rapid tightening by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. Central bank tightening plans may change as a result of lower global growth, but the US Treasury market suggests a greater awareness of heightened inflation (for example, the 5-year inflation breakeven went above 3% for the first time in its history).3
How have markets reacted to past military conflicts?
Market performance has varied greatly during previous conflicts and usually also depends on the ongoing economic situation. For example, the Yom Kippur war of 1973 led to a quadrupling of the oil price, high inflation, recession, a squeeze on profits and a sharp decline in the value of bonds and equities.4 On the other hand, when the US and its allies invaded Iraq in 2003, equity markets continued higher, partly because the invasion had been long-anticipated and partly because equity markets were just exiting the bursting phase of the dotcom bubble.5
This time, energy prices are rising, which presents a threat to household budgets and business profits (except for the energy sector). Also, the disruption to Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus will impact trade flows, which could further dampen the global economy, especially Europe. The extent of the hit to global gross domestic product (GDP) depends upon how long the conflict lasts, but we suspect it could amount to 0.5%-1.0% less global GDP this year – enough to accentuate the ongoing deceleration but not enough to cause recession (except for in those countries in the immediate vicinity). Much of this may already be priced in to markets.
Could freezing Russia from SWIFT hurt markets?
First of all, let’s define SWIFT – it is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. It is a messaging system that enables rapid, secure financial transactions, and it’s the dominant global system for banking transactions.
Russia is very reliant on SWIFT: According to the Russian National Swift Association, approximately 300 banks and other financial institutions in the country utilize the SWIFT system, and Russia is ranked second (behind the United States) by number of users of the platform.6 Russia is so heavily dependent on SWIFT because of the high level of energy it exports denominated in US dollars. There has been reluctance to ban Russia from SWIFT because of the dramatic impact it would have — it would restrict Russia’s access to financial markets globally and drive up oil prices by essentially preventing Russia from selling its oil internationally. Some worry it could create global financial systemic risk.
However, Russia’s increasingly aggressive actions have prompted more economic punishment in recent days, with the United States and the European Union banning some Russian banks from SWIFT. Prior to this action, the only country banned from SWIFT was Iran; the action had a very substantial impact on the country, causing a one-third drop in foreign trade, specifically sharply reducing its oil exports.7
In the case of Russia, it is important to note that it has not been fully excluded from SWIFT – the exclusions impact specific banks, which appear intended to make it harder to evade the prior specific sanctions on those banks. Energy exports are apparently carved out from these sanctions, though there is some risk that energy exports may be harder to transact and settle, contributing to higher energy, metals, and grains prices.
How might sanctions impact Russia’s economy and war effort?
The West has frozen much of the Central Bank of Russia’s (CBR) foreign assets, thought to be roughly half its $630 billion in foreign reserves held in the Western financial system.8 This should make it much more difficult for the CBR to defend the ruble. When markets opened, the Russian ruble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the US dollar.9 In response to the ruble’s drop, the CBR announced a large hike in interest rates — from 9.5% to 20% — in order to help defend the ruble.10 Since then, the ruble has recovered about half its earlier drop. The CBR has also reportedly banned the sale of domestic securities held by non-residents. Further capital controls, including on Russian residents, are a rising risk, given the difficulty of directly defending the ruble with foreign exchange reserves.
For historical context, there have been a few times in recent history that the West has imposed sanctions freezing parts of the Central Bank of Russia’s official foreign exchange reserves. These freezes have been imposed on Venezuela, North Korea, and Iran (Iran’s foreign assets were frozen during the 1979 US embassy hostage crisis.) All three of these countries became increasingly isolated from the international financial system. However, both Iran and Venezuela were still able to carry on their oil operations, and Iran and North Korea were able to maintain nuclear programs.
We expect dramatic pressure on the Russian financial system and economy, comparable to a major financial crisis (including sharply higher inflation and an accompanying squeeze on the spending power of the average Russian). Runs on the banks and the Russian ruble cannot be ruled out – in fact, they may already have begun. Sharp interest rate hikes, already enacted, are so far proving ineffective. Domestic deposit freezes and capital controls cannot be ruled out – restrictions on foreigners are already being imposed by Russia.
There will also likely be a significant movement to divest Russian assets, adding to economic pressure and isolation. For example, the Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, just announced it would divest of all Russian assets. BP has indicated that it will divest itself of its stake in Rosneft, Russia’s state-near oil major, quite likely at large cost to its shareholders.
Some Western firms have indicated that they will cease operations involving Russia, including in logistics and delivery. These decisions seem likely to hit Russia’s real economy hard. It is important to stress that the impact of the conflict, while negative, is likely to be very localized with the greatest impact on Russia and Ukraine’s respective economies and markets.
The combination of financial sanctions, market and banking system pressures, and damage to the real economy may undermine Russia’s war effort over time, especially if there is a protracted ground war with continued strong Ukrainian resistance. There is some hope that these efforts will increase the chances of negotiations toward a settlement (Russia is likely to suffer a severe form of stagflation).
In summary, it is hard to know all the financial system ramifications of economic sanctions on Russia, especially banning Russia from SWIFT. We will have to follow the situation very closely as it evolves.
What will major central banks do?
The Russia-Ukraine crisis presents central banks with a dilemma: Should they respond to the threat of higher inflation due to rising energy prices (by raising rates more aggressively) or should they react to the decline in spending power and consumer confidence (by slowing monetary tightening)?
Markets seem to believe that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will become more dovish. While fed funds futures are still suggesting there could be six rate hikes this year, the expectations for a 50 basis point rate hike in March have fallen.11 We ourselves agree these conflicting pressures could tilt the Fed towards a 25 basis point hike rather than 50 basis points in March and that the European Central Bank may remain on the fence for longer.
If financial markets remain volatile (and bearing in mind the risk of united consequences for the financial system from the sanctions on Russia), the Fed may choose to hold rates at its March policy meeting as it waits for more clarity on the implications. We believe this is unlikely, but possible as an extreme measure.
How can Europe keep its economy going strong if Russian oil and gas is cut off?
The reality is that Europe will be negatively impacted by the economic sanctions imposed upon Russia, but it is unclear how much. For example, European natural gas prices are on the rise as I write this .12 If that were to persist, it could be quite problematic. That’s why European Union energy ministers are meeting today to discuss ways to help maintain energy supplies. There is no magic solution, but Europe may need to resort to fiscal and monetary stimulus to help it manage its economy through this crisis.
Europe’s economic prospects would be severely damaged if Russia decides to cut energy exports in retaliation (Russia supplied 29% of Europe’s crude oil imports in 2020, along with 39% of its petroleum product imports and 80% of its pipeline gas imports).13 Russia had reportedly increased gas supplies to Europe as it launched the invasion of Ukraine. It has also said that it will only use non-economic retaliation to Western economic sanctions – though of course it denied plans to invade until hours before the war began. Alternatives to Russian gas exports through liquefied natural gas exports from Qatar and the US are already being substituted (though Qatar’s production is a fraction of that of Russia).14
How might different sectors/asset classes be affected?

Commodities exported by Russia and Ukraine should be clear beneficiaries in our view, as prices are likely to go up given expectations of reduced supply. This includes oil, natural gas, palladium, aluminum, wheat, and corn.
Canadian stocks could benefit from rising commodity prices, given the economy’s reliance on resource extraction. Indeed, firming raw materials prices have been an important link in a chain of positive events for Canada. Simply put, what’s good for materials prices is generally good for the Canadian economy. Global growth, early-stage commodity prices (as measured by the CRB Raw Industrials Index), the loonie, and Canadian stocks typically move in the same direction across time. The same can be said for Australian assets.
European stocks are likely to face conflicting pressures. Several major eurozone financial stocks have sizeable Russian operations and are already under pressure. Also, Europe is more at risk of recession, especially if energy supplies are cut. However, if the conflict is short-lived, the risk of higher inflation, somewhat tighter monetary policy than today even if more dovish than previously expected, and potentially steeper yield curves could be more beneficial for indexes heavier in value, cyclical, and commodity stocks – such as EU and UK indexes, than indices heavier in growth and tech stocks, like the US.
The US dollar, Swiss franc and Japanese yen should continue to benefit from their “safe haven” status in turbulent environments. The Chinese yuan is also benefitting from this period of uncertainty, perhaps because it is distant from Europe and also because it has better relations with Russia. The Russian ruble should continue to face headwinds.
Gold should benefit, in our view, from its status as a hedge against geopolitical risk.
Cybersecurity stocks may benefit. We are already seeing cyberattacks as part of this conflict, and there is growing concern that could escalate. In particular, there is fear that Russia could initiate a major cyberattack on the United States or European Union.
Aerospace and defense stocks are also likely to benefit. Germany has announced that it will now respect the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s commitment to dedicate at least 2% of GDP to military expenditures, versus its range of 1.19%-1.36% between 2014 and 2019.15 Many other European countries are below that 2% target and are likely to make efforts to reach it. Not only would that boost military expenditures, it could also provide a medium-term boost to the European economy, depending upon how it is financed.
We believe there is still opportunity in emerging markets, but one needs to be selective in that space; we would avoid Russia and Ukraine during this crisis. Distance from the theatre of war (and the ire of Russian President Vladimir Putin) could be an advantage which favors Asia and Latin American markets, in our view
For stocks in general, the announcement of stringent sanctions against Russia suggests the VIX could rise again. We believe that levels above 40 are a good sign for future returns.

Key takeaways
We don’t own any Russian companies¹
Therefore, we would not be directly exposed to any potential sanctions on Russian firms.
We don’t own any bank stocks¹
We’ve had a long-standing bias against the industry, particularly in the non-US developed markets of Europe.
We don’t own any oil and gas dependent companies¹
We don’t own utilities, oil and gas companies, or any industrial commodity producers.

We’ve been asked about the potential effect that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would have on the Invesco Oppenheimer International Growth Fund. Thinking through some of the more likely “what if” possibilities, we would expect to see relatively little impact beyond the general market volatility. Here’s why.  
We don’t own any Russian companies
An invasion of Ukraine may lead to sanctions being imposed by the US or other countries on various Russian individuals and companies. The Invesco Oppenheimer International Growth Fund does not hold positions in any companies in Russia or Eastern Europe. Therefore, we would not be directly exposed to any sanctions. 
We don’t own any bank stocks
Another potential risk is that Russia may be denied access to the payment system SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications), which is used by banks to transfer funds to each other internationally. Were that to happen, the flow of funds into Russia would rapidly fall to a trickle, and that in turn could cause Russia to default on its external debt, as it did in 1998. 
Ours is purely an equity portfolio, so we don’t have any direct debt exposure.  Nor do we own any banks, due to our long-standing bias against the industry, particularly in the non-US developed markets of Europe. Therefore, we don’t have any indirect exposure through banks that may hold Russian debt.  
We don’t own any oil and gas producers
Given that Russia is a significant supplier of oil and gas, providing the European Union with about a third of their needs,2 one could expect volatility in the prices of those commodities and of companies in that sector. If Russia cuts Europe off from its gas supplies, as some have speculated it might, gas prices and the cost to gas users would certainly rise significantly, at least in the short term. 
However, we don’t own any oil and gas producers, and none of the companies in our portfolio are particularly dependent on oil and gas. This lack of direct and indirect exposure is not a response to the current geopolitical tension. Rather, it simply reflects our long-standing biases. The most intensive energy using companies are utilities and industrial commodity manufacturers. We don’t own utilities, given the fixed income nature of the returns from most of them. We don’t own any oil and gas companies, nor any industrial commodity producers, because we don’t like investing in commoditized businesses. 
We’ve seen similar situations before
Finally, it’s worth mentioning that we have thought through these issues before: in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea; and in 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, to name just two times. Our portfolio then was very similar to our portfolio now: a diversified group of companies that we believe are high quality and have the requisite pricing power to monetize long-term structural growth trends regardless of where we are in the business or commodity price cycle. Looking back, one might argue that history displays a degree of consistency. Our portfolio certainly does.

Key takeaways
Military operations have begun
Russia has launched military operations against Ukraine, Ukraine has declared martial law, and the West is ramping up financial sanctions against Russia.
Assessing the economic impact
In our view, the economic impact on the rest of the world is likely to come from higher commodity prices, boosting inflation but hurting growth – stagflation-lite.
How will central banks respond?
We expect a somewhat less hawkish stance from major central banks – tilting the Federal Reserve toward a 25 basis point hike in March and keeping the European Central Bank on the fence.

Russia has launched military operations against Ukraine. Ukraine has declared martial law. Fighting and shelling are underway in parts of Ukraine. We fear there will be significant disruption in the region, including loss of life. The West is ramping up financial sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine.
Market reaction so far is risk-off but not indiscriminate. Movements across asset classes and regions reflect macro exposure to striking moves in commodities most affected by the conflict.
As of this writing, on Feb. 24:

Commodities: Oil, gas, grains and palladium have risen sharply. Russia is a major exporter of all of these, and Ukraine of grains.
Currencies: US dollar, Swiss franc, Japanese yen have rallied; the euro and sterling are weaker.
Bonds: US Treasuries, eurozone government bonds led by German Bunds, and UK Gilts have all rallied.
Equities: Indexes were off across the board, led by EMEA. Countries with strong Russia trade links like Germany have fared less well than energy-producing nations. The S&P 500 Index rose later in the day.
Emerging Markets: Russia/Ukraine are down sharply. Commodity importers such as Turkey and India have been hit harder than exporters such as Brazil. Mexican peso and South African rand (bellwether proxies for emerging markets risk), are softer but so far holding up reasonably well.

Implications
We believe we are in a full-blown open conflict scenario. Open conflict in Europe is clearly a major shock to the international system. We do expect, however, hostilities to focus on Ukrainian territory given the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s protection of Western Europe. Hence, we believe collateral damage would be heaviest in Ukraine and Russia, with important but not extreme effects beyond those two economies;  Europe most exposed, the US and Asia less so with many emerging markets in between.
In our view, the economic impact on the rest of the world is likely to come from higher commodity prices, boosting inflation but hurting growth – stagflation-lite. But if hostilities and tensions escalate to the point where Russia is excluded from the Western payments and fast-messaging systems, as was Iran, a severe stagflation shock could result from an interruption of energy supplies. Russia supplies Europe with 40% of its gas, half its solid fuel including coal, and about a quarter of its oil.1
We expect the consequences to translate into a somewhat less hawkish stance from major central banks – tilting the Federal Reserve toward a 25 basis point hike in March and keeping the European Central Bank on the fence.
The long-term consequences are likely to be profound but play out over time. Where national interests and ideologies are concerned, we see foreign economic policies focusing on reducing or at least managing national security risks, moving away from encouraging economic and financial integration, thereby increasing interdependence and raising the cost of conflict.
Bottom Line
We expect high market volatility to continue in the near term but note past conflicts have often provided interesting entry points for long-term investors. The war (and the risk of stagflation) strengthens the case for portfolio diversification given the heightened volatility and uncertainty.

Key takeaways
The crisis escalates
Russian President Vladimir Putin has recognized the breakaway “People’s Republics” in eastern Ukraine and ordered Russian troops to begin a “peacemaking operation” there.
Investors anticipate the market implications
Investors are nervous that further hostilities could undermine stability in Europe, and that sanctions could drive up energy, metals, and grain prices.
We assess the potential impact
We believe the actual economic and market disruption is likely to fall mainly in Ukraine and Russia — unless there is open war.

As I write this, the crisis among Russia, Ukraine and the West has escalated. Russian President Vladimir Putin has recognized the breakaway “People’s Republics” in eastern Ukraine and ordered Russian troops to begin a “peacemaking operation” there. This represents a breakdown in negotiations and diplomacy, but it is still short of open warfare.
Above all else, my thoughts are with everyone in the region, and I pray that world leaders can de-escalate the situation and avoid the loss of life and human devastation that war would bring. For the purposes of this piece, I will examine the potential ramifications from an economic and market perspective.
What are the implications for the global economy?
Investors are understandably nervous that further hostilities could undermine stability in Europe, and that retaliatory sanctions by the West and counter-sanctions by Russia could drive up energy, metals, and grain prices, which would slow global economic recovery and boost inflation pressures.
It seems likely that there will be at least some further escalation from here, though we are still quite far from a full-blown invasion or extreme sanctions that might seriously damage the global economy. The outbreak of hostilities is a serious source of geopolitical tension and financial volatility, but we believe the actual economic and market disruption is likely to fall mainly in Ukraine and Russia, with some risk to the rest of Europe but limited fallout for the world as a whole — unless there is open war.
What are the implications for the asset classes?
Let’s discuss what this likely means for various asset classes:

Stocks: The bad news is that this geopolitical crisis will only amplify the volatility and potential sell-offs created by the start of monetary policy tightening. The good news is that it is likely to be short-lived, at least for major markets – though pressure and volatility in regional markets is likely to continue. My colleague Paul Jackson looked at six historical conflicts (WW1, WW2, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Yom Kippur War, the Kuwait War and the Iraq War), and found that the S&P 500 Index (and prior to its existence, the US equity market equivalent as constructed by Robert Shiller) has on average lost 9% following the start of those conflicts.1 However, it bottomed within 12 months and recovered the losses within 18 months.1
Oil: Oil is likely to be impacted by a Russian invasion of Ukraine, especially if there are extreme sanctions, as I mentioned in last week’s blog. Paul Jackson reviewed the history of oil prices and found that, as expressed in today’s prices, an oil price of $100 is rare (West Texas Intermediate has been above $100 in only 8% of months since January 1870).2 In fact, demand and supply dynamics have typically brought the price of oil back into the $20-$60 range (in today’s prices).2 A variety of factors — the strong economic recovery, reduced supply, and geopolitics — have pushed prices upward but seem unlikely to endure. If we look at spot and futures prices, short-dated prices are currently much higher than longer-dated prices (a phenomenon called backwardation). This is because there is a perceived risk of shortages in the short term due to strong demand and anticipated disruptions in supply from Russia. Such a degree of backwardation rarely persists and is usually resolved by a decline in shorter-dated prices.                                                                                                                                                                            We have to remember that the global economy is far less dependent on oil than it was in the 1970s. Now there could very well be a visceral reaction to a ramping up of the conflict from here that drives up oil prices in the short run, but we are inclined to believe that much may already be priced in given the run up in oil prices that we have seen thus far. It is also worth noting that the United States is currently in negotiations with Iran and may reduce sanctions there, leading to a significant increase in available oil supply which should help limit the rise in oil prices. That said, bringing Iran’s oil exports back into the global market would not be a perfect substitute for any interruption in Russia’s oil exports. Russia is the third-largest oil producer in the world, producing about 11 million barrels per day, exporting about 4.3 million barrels per day, and supplies about a quarter of Western Europe’s oil imports.3 Based on a variety of official and private sources, Iran’s total oil output is less than a third of Russia’s and its exportable surplus is less than half as much, some of which is already being exported despite the sanctions.3
Gas: Russia is a crucial exporter, accounting for about 40% of Western Europe’s imports.4 The International Energy Agency (IEA) reckons that Russia had already reduced supplies to the West by about 30%, contributing to spikes and higher energy prices throughout Europe.4 Gas on the spot market had already surged roughly in line with oil at the time of writing. Gas supplies via liquified natural gas and other sources in the Middle East and worldwide are being diverted to Western Europe, but further reductions in Russia’s gas exports would probably drive up prices and could pose a headwind to consumption during the winter by driving up global gas and other energy prices. Gas is especially worth keeping an eye on since it tends to be a more localized market distributed through pipelines rather than shipped from exporting to importing countries — which could provide Russia more direct leverage against retaliatory sanctions than oil, which is a somewhat more global market.
Other commodities: As I mentioned last week, Russia is the largest exporter of palladium and is also a significant exporter of other metals. Ukraine and Russia also are major producers of wheat and, for Ukraine, corn. So I expect prices of those commodities to rise.
Gold: Gold has historically exhibited a relatively close correlation with geopolitical risks. One study found that gold shows a strong positive relationship with geopolitical risks, unlike other precious metals.5 A one standard deviation change in the Geopolitical Risk Index resulted in a 0.80% gold price return.5 I would expect gold to rise if the situation in Ukraine escalates further.
Cryptocurrency: Given that Bitcoin is often described as “digital gold,” investors seem eager to assume Bitcoin has many of the same characteristics as this precious metal. However, the gold and geopolitical risk study I referenced above revealed that the price of Bitcoin is not correlated to geopolitical risks.5 Having said that, we have to recognize this study was released four years ago, and Bitcoin’s behavior has changed in recent years as it has gone “mainstream.” However, I do not expect Bitcoin to be a hedge against geopolitical risks going forward. While the price of gold has risen as geopolitical risks have increased, the price of Bitcoin has fallen in the past week.6
Safe-haven fiat currencies and conventional “safe assets”: During periods of significant geopolitical turbulence that truly threaten the global economy, a few conventional financial assets tend to do well, outperforming risk assets like stocks that are more directly geared to growth. These include the US dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc as well as US Treasuries, Japanese Government Bonds, and German Bunds.

At the time of this writing, we don’t see all that much upward pressure on these “safe assets,” with the major currencies and bond markets being driven mainly by views about inflation and central bank policies. Nor do we see downward pressure on the euro, for example. This is in line with our view that, barring a full-scale invasion, the crisis is likely to remain localized both economically and financially.
Sanctions have already begun and will probably be ratcheted up — but we believe they are likely to remain largely targeted against specific individuals, firms, and sectors in Russia, rather than broader measures that prevent European energy imports and limit Russia’s ability to export. That said, if hostilities do target Kiev or extend to a full-blown invasion of Ukraine, sanctions are likely to be ramped up, posing a greater challenge in global markets. It is worth noting that Germany has already put a stop to approval of Nord Stream 2, a second gas pipeline which could allow Russian gas exports to Western Europe to bypass Ukraine. If there is a full invasion, the project could conceivably be cancelled and other tougher sanctions imposed. But sanctions on Russia are only one way prices could be driven higher. Russia could also reduce exports as a non-military tool to inflict economic pain. In addition, if the military conflict escalates, there could be damage to infrastructure that reduces the production and export of commodities.
Given the increase in tensions and the real risk of further hostilities, stocks are likely to get volatile and a bit messy in the short run, and oil and gas prices could easily move higher in the short run. There have historically been few asset classes that have been effective hedges against geopolitical risk, although gold has been one of them along with the dollar, yen and Swiss franc. In this environment, investors should remind themselves of their time horizon before reacting emotionally to events that are likely to have a short-term impact on asset classes.
And while various economists’ and strategists’ forecasts for Federal Reserve rate hikes this year continue to increase, last week saw signs that the Fed may have a more measured approach to hikes in 2022:

The Federal Reserve Board of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations released last week showed that longer-term inflation expectations peaked in the fall and have since fallen materially.
Federal Open Market Committee minutes showed that Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis President James Bullard appears to be an outlier in terms of his views on tightening; they were in general more dovish than expected. While there was a desire for a “significant reduction in the size of the balance sheet,” it was clear the Fed will remain very data dependent when it comes to tightening.

Looking ahead
In addition to monitoring the situation with Russia and Ukraine, I will be most interested in:

The Conference Board’s US Consumer Confidence Survey
Japan and eurozone flash estimates of Purchasing Managers Indexes
US gross domestic product
The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index. I would like to see confirmation of the inflation expectations we saw recently in the New York Fed’s Survey.

Key takeaways
Real estate houses the economy
As the oldest asset class, it is relevant to all of us in our daily lives.
We will always need somewhere to Consume, Live, Innovate, and Connect
Our CLIC framework helps guide our thinking about real estate opportunities today.

Longtime real estate investors are well-acquainted with the “Residential, Industrial, Office and Retail” framework that has defined this space for decades. But Invesco Real Estate takes a different approach — one that we believe better represents the evolving range of opportunities that real estate offers investors.
The evolving role of real estate
Real estate literally and figuratively houses the economy. Even though it may be the oldest asset class, it is always relevant to not just investors, but to each and every one of us in our daily lives.
We always need somewhere to Consume, Live, Innovate and Connect – somewhere to CLIC. These are the structural trends that guide our thinking and shape our views when it comes to seeking out new investment opportunities in what is a constantly evolving market environment.
